The dialectical and cynical interpretation is: in normal circumstances, they are others that we fail to see as human, for they have been, in a greater sense, symbolised as a service, a function, a cog in the machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are we becoming more indifferent? The dilemma is: we do feel and express our fury and pity for food couriers being exploited online (see the Twitter result for \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=deliveroo%20exploit&amp;src=typed_query\">Deliveroo<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=Uber%20Eats%20exploit&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\">Uber Eats<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=Just%20Eat%20exploit&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\">Just Eat exploit<\/a>\u2019], but at the end of the day, our direct interest in when our food will arrive and why stuff is missing will still override any interest in the life-stories of the person making it happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems like our imaginations of others are dissolved in \u201cpaying for a service\u201d.

Slowly, every social interaction has been chiselled away \u2014 booking apps so you don&#8217;t have to ring up and speak to someone, delivery services so you don&#8217;t need to speak with front of house, dark kitchens so back of house is even spatially hidden away.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A theory about the uniforms of a company is proposed in Ken Loach\u2019s film,&nbsp;<em>Bread and Roses(2000)<\/em>: they \u201cmake us invisible\u201d.

He is hunching over on the edge of a flower bed, waiting to pick up an order from the restaurant across. \u201cHe\u2019s not being paid right now, but he&#8217;s at work, right? And I&#8217;m at work right now. I stepped out for coffee, but I have a salary and that\u2019s really powerful. It means that there&#8217;s some sense of protection about what I do, and value and respect. But everyone should have that. All jobs should look like that on some level.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By binding the self-employed status of the courier to notions like \u201cvoluntariness\u201d and \u201creciprocity\u201d, Deliveroo has managed to erase holiday pay, sick pay, fuel and vehicle costs, and payment for any time the courier isn\u2019t spending on delivering. The company is famous for providing flexibility and not paying its couriers minimum wage. One-third of its couriers made on average&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebureauinvestigates.com\/stories\/2021-03-25\/deliveroo-riders-earning-as-little-as-2-pounds\">less than \u00a38.72<\/a>&nbsp;according to a 2021 survey of over 300 couriers by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebureauinvestigates.com\/stories\/2021-03-25\/deliveroo-riders-earning-as-little-as-2-pounds\">Deliveroo<\/a>&nbsp;insists on this sample to be \u201cnot a meaningful or representative proportion\u201d for couriers are not required to work in an hourly pattern so the average pay should be calculated \u201cfrom the moment a rider accepts a Deliveroo order until they complete the order\u201d.

And their migration status is often one of the sources of their exploitation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food couriers have finally been recognised as essential workers in the pandemic, but despite the verbal elevation, there hasn\u2019t been any rise in their working conditions. JustEat\u2019s subcontractor, Stuart Delivery, cut the minimum delivery pay in Sheffield by 24%, from \u00a34.50 to \u00a33.40 on 6 December 2021. This triggered the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/iwgb.org.uk\/en\/post\/justeat-greggs\">longest gig-economy strike<\/a>&nbsp;by local couriers which is still ongoing to this day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deliveroo got its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in London in March 2021 with an investment from Amazon in the anticipation that it will stay till the end-game and become the gatekeeper of the industry. It has indeed robustly expanded its UK market share to 77% at the end of 2021 from 53% at the end of 2020. But Tiago says: \u201cThey\u2019re paying less than they actually used to pay before, which is funny as all prices are rising in the UK. It was really rare to have a delivery fee of \u00a32.90 in the past on Deliveroo but now it\u2019s something normal. It used to be always more than \u00a33.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are also couriers very satisfied with the job. Shajon Hussain, worked at the Soho Sandwich factory when he first moved to the UK from Bangladesh about half a year ago before he took up the delivery work. It could take him three hours on the train and bus to work. Despite leaving home at 4 am., he was often late due to unpredictable traffic problems, which angered his boss. The job was paid approximately \u00a31100 per month, but now he keeps a weekly income of \u00a3450-600 with Deliveroo and Uber Eats. \u201cIf it&#8217;s busy, I work. If not, I come back. It\u2019s flexible. It\u2019s self-employment, you know?\u201d he says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1647703377691-fb6852141188?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>Image provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1647703377691-fb6852141188?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1647703377691-fb6852141188?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Upsplash<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Either precarious flexible self-employment or stable inflexible employment, this is our common default assumption. But Dr Woodcock says, \u201cthere&#8217;s no reason why employment can&#8217;t be flexible. Apart from employers not wanting it to be flexible.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;Independent Workers&#8217; Union of Great Britain (IWGB)&nbsp;has been fighting through courts to reclassify couriers as limb (b), an existing non-binary employment status in the UK, which subjects independent workers to basic employment rights. But last year\u2019s Court of Appeal <a href=\"https:\/\/dwfgroup.com\/en\/news-and-insights\/insights\/2021\/7\/deliveroo-court-of-appeal-finds-riders-are-not-in-an-employment-relationship#:~:text=In%20a%20unanimous%20judgment,%20the,European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights\">rejected IWGB\u2019s appeal for the fourth time<\/a>, for one term in Deliveroo\u2019s contract: it is allowed to have a different person using the same courier account, which contradicts the personal performance obligation in&nbsp;the definition of employees under&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.equalityhumanrights.com\/en\/human-rights-act\/article-11-freedom-assembly-and-association#:~:text=Everyone%20has%20the%20right%20to,the%20protection%20of%20his%20interests.\">Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout history, every tech advancement brings in a labour market reform with jobs catering to the new way of production, i.e. the interest of the factories and companies, and decades later, the workers rise up with demonstrations to articulate their interests and rights. This process sometimes needs generations to fuel up. What\u2019s perhaps cheeringly surprising in this cycle of platform work is how it has happened incredibly quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IWGB has done incredible work&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/iwgb.org.uk\/en\/post\/iwgb-wins-groundbreaking-health-and-safety-legal-challenge-against-the-government\">winning gig workers<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/iwgb.org.uk\/en\/post\/iwgb-wins-groundbreaking-health-and-safety-legal-challenge-against-the-government\"> health and safety protections<\/a>, and worker status for&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/iwgb.org.uk\/en\/post\/iwgb-wins-worker-status-and-rights-for-gig-economy-citysprint-couriers-once-and-for-all\">CitySprint&nbsp;couriers<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/iwgb.org.uk\/en\/post\/landmark-legal-victory-opens-door-to-worker-rights-for-uk-foster-carers\">foster care workers<\/a>, but there is little more that can be done to safeguard the rights of couriers under current domestic laws that fully allow Deliveroo to escape liability and do not take into account the nuances of gig work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1589829545856-d10d557cf95f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption>Image provided by <a href=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1589829545856-d10d557cf95f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1589829545856-d10d557cf95f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Upsplash<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s about how as a society, we can think through the bargain of work\u201d, says Dr Woodcock, \u201cIt\u2019s about having a political debate about whether employment law works in the way it does now, whether the tax system works for supporting people, whether labour market enforcement is working in the right way, and seeing that that kind of collective discussion and voice is what drives forward work.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The on-demand delivery industry is aggressively expanding, copying the model to other services like grocery, laundry, manicurists, salons, parking and so on.
