The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.shortfilms.org.uk\/events\/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.shortfilms.org.uk\/events\/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities\" target=\"_blank\">event<\/a>, held at the Institute of Contemporary Art, aimed at digging into and contemplating the richness and fragility of ecosystems, where several, divergent beings run into the other and interact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The single human character, played by Bedfordshire actor Carl Welch, is an elderly man whose name remains unknown almost to avoid any specification that could limit the narrative to only one person. He spends the days growing plants in his garden and, as if these were mirrors of his solitary existence, shielding them from the attacks of starlings that land on the allotment and eat produce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cThe movie captures the loneliness of capitalist societies in our disconnection from nature,\u201d said Emma Bouraba, who curated the programme and took part in the pre-selection of films to be later shortlisted for this year\u2019s edition of the Festival. \u201cIt shows the fight we have against the ecology we are a part of.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Starlings turn out to be the ultimate species to convey this message. They act as intruders that invade and hinder the cynical, self-centred and isolated life cycle of the man and his vines, which reject any experience of concurrence and seek their expulsion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cI got googling starlings and I was like, wait, everyone hates these birds,\u201d said Prew. \u201cThey are huge pests: a big problem for agriculture and farming.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aphis.usda.gov\/wildlife_damage\/reports\/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series\/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.aphis.usda.gov\/wildlife_damage\/reports\/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series\/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">research<\/a>, European starlings are often the reason of damages to apples, blue berries, cherries, figs and grapes, as they either cause direct losses from eating fruits or reduce product quality by pecking and slashing at them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The ecology portrayed in the film is analogous. Human conventions are unearthed and relentlessly confronted with the perseverance of the birds that, despite the manifold attempts set out by the man to send them away, carry on returning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">An anti-bird netting, stifling and tightening around the plants, as if to put an end to the growth that would bring them into a direct discovery of their surroundings; ultrasonic repellents to annoy the birds and even the classic scarecrow, made from scraps, cuttings, leftover buttons, that the protagonist tries and make abnormal and intimidating in accordance with human perception, which is accustomed to creating and loathing what is Other. All efforts would fail in their intent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"531\" src=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/scarecrow-1024x531.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/scarecrow-1024x531.png 1024w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/scarecrow-300x156.png 300w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/scarecrow-768x398.png 768w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/scarecrow-1200x623.png 1200w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/scarecrow.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>All attempts to remove birds prove ineffective.

Nonetheless, the solution would be meanly found by killing one of them, ultimately eliminating what is seen as unwelcome and further isolating from the experience of social contact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"531\" src=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/starling-dead-1024x531.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/starling-dead-1024x531.png 1024w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/starling-dead-300x156.png 300w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/starling-dead-768x398.png 768w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/starling-dead-1200x623.png 1200w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/starling-dead.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>The man kills one of the birds in his garden. From <em>Starlings<\/em>, 2021.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Shot during the second wave of harder restrictions imposed in the U.K. to quell the spread of the coronavirus, the short film was able to touch on the question of loneliness as people were increasingly becoming familiar with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cI wrote the script before lockdown happened and before we even knew anything about Covid-19,\u201d said Prew. \u201cThen the subject matter became even more prevalent.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/wellbeing\/bulletins\/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain\/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/wellbeing\/bulletins\/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain\/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">survey<\/a> published by the Office for National Statistics in 2020, the equivalent of 7.4 million people said that their well-being was affected through feeling lonely during the first month of lockdown. In particular, research found that those aged 16 to 24 were more likely to have experienced loneliness due to Covid-19 tough regulations, namely 50.8% of respondents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">A previous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.basw.co.uk\/system\/files\/resources\/basw_94738-5_0.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.basw.co.uk\/system\/files\/resources\/basw_94738-5_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report<\/a> that had looked into the impact of loneliness in similar age groups in 2017, published by U.K. charity Action for Children and the MP Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, had found that 43% of young people had undergone through such feelings even prior to the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The actual number of teenagers and young adults suffering from this condition might even be higher, as loneliness often trivially conceals among people who experience it despite the fact they are not necessarily alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cLoneliness is a subjective feeling that arises when one feels that there is a gap between their desired and actual social contacts,\u201d said Sam Fardghassemi, who is teaching fellow in the Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology at UCL and has conducted in-depth work to analyse the issue in young people of London.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Due to this ambivalence, loneliness differs from social isolation. This circumstance, in which the man is presented in the first half of the film, can be described as the objective, partial reduction or total exclusion of other social contacts from one person\u2019s daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Japan has often been associated with the issue. In the country, young adults who are socially reclused are estimated to have topped 500,000 and different nuances of withdrawal have been found over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><em>Sotokomori<\/em> (Japanese for withdrawn, outside) refers to people whose outings are only limited to pursuing their interests, their agenda, or fulfilling practical needs such as food shopping. A more acute type of isolation concerns <em>hikikomori<\/em> (Japanese for withdrawn, inside), who are known to totally cut themselves off from the external world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The latter state is emphasised in the man\u2019s purchase of ultrasonic repellents to try and get rid of the birds, that he makes online, without leaving home and confining in a comfort zone he has built, whereby nothing else can meddle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cIt is as if they continue to exist as a being while being socially dead, and passively observing outside activities,\u201d said Dr Maki Rooksby of the Institute of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Glasgow, whose expertise also covers social isolation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Discovered in the mid-1980s as a socio-cultural phenomenon by Japanese psychiatrist Tamaki Saito, who would later coin the term, hikikomori only seemed to belong to Japan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@neetworks\/video\/6941889805500435717\" data-video-id=\"6941889805500435717\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\" style=\"max-width:605px; min-width:325px;\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@neetworks\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@neetworks?refer=embed\">@neetworks<\/a> <p><\/p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"\u266c original sound - Moni Kinoko\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/music\/original-sound-6941889606367382277?refer=embed\">\u266c original sound &#8211; Moni Kinoko<\/a> <\/section> <\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cI had not come across anything the same as hikikomori, as a recognised, semi-widespread, identifiable social phenomenon in the UK,\u201d said Professor Robert MacDonald, who is co-Editor in Chief of Journal of Youth Studies, referring to a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.the-sarf.org.uk\/the-new-british-hikikomori\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"http:\/\/www.the-sarf.org.uk\/the-new-british-hikikomori\/\" target=\"_blank\">piece<\/a> he had written in 2015 about the existence of British hikikomori.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">More recently, things might have changed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cAlthough we don&#8217;t know very much whether some countries are more vulnerable to it and how, we know it is a global mental health issue today, with cases reported throughout the world,\u201d said Dr Rooksby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Identifying, gauging and understanding the issue allows us to figure out the most appropriate solutions to let patients get back to appreciating the beauty of discovery and contact with what is around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">\u201cEffective treatment approaches include those where clinicians tune in with the withdrawn person and share the journey of exploring interests or activities that may help them find meaning in their lives,\u201d said Dr Rooksby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">In the case of the protagonist, the journey will be the pictorial flight of starlings shown in a documentary on television, where the birds dance and shape cinematic images in the sky in a rigorous-yet-liberating synchronised hymn to community and interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"531\" src=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/murmurations-1024x531.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/murmurations-1024x531.png 1024w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/murmurations-300x156.png 300w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/murmurations-768x398.png 768w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/murmurations-1200x623.png 1200w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/murmurations.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>The man watches a TV documentary on starlings murmurations.
