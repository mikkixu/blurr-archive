Since their invention, prior to 7500 BC, bricks have become a viable alternative in construction. But they have also gained a poignant meaning in history that is synonymous with peoples, families. Arrivals, departures, encounters. Because, with bricks, dwellings are built, bridges are erected, markets and community centres are created, roads are levelled, connecting and putting a place on the map, giving it life, presence, relevance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Brick Lane, and in the areas of Spitalfields and Tower Hamlets in East London, bricks have become the idiosyncratic allegory of centuries of traditions, communities. Growth, blended with stability. A stability achieved through inclusivity, acceptance, and a flow of transformations that, in the course of its existence, marked it to the point of becoming a crossroads open to all and in the heart of everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have always been here,\u201d said Rahad Miah, who works at the popular Bengal Village, while listening to traditional Bengali music in the background. \u201cI was used to coming when I was a kid and I am still here.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/thumbnail_image007-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-733\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/thumbnail_image007-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/thumbnail_image007-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/thumbnail_image007-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/thumbnail_image007.jpg 1111w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Photo by Simone Pellegrino.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A field path in the countryside outside the City of London in 1500s, the street welcomed early Flemish settlers, whose brick kilns gave it its characteristic name. But it was not until the second half of 17<sup>th<\/sup> century, when other roads were laid out, that the area started developing and taking its modern, urban appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among other buildings, breweries popped up prosperously. The largest site, extended over the centuries, was bought by Joseph Truman in 1676 and kept actively producing beer until the end of 1990s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-965\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg 1516w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>The Old Truman Brewery. Photo by Simone Pellegrino.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently owned by the Zeloof partnership, the complex has been used by small independent businesses as well as grassroots creative and cultural organisations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2021, the latest chapter of a long story of mutations began. A local committee approved <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk\/documents\/s190863\/Appendix%201%20-%20PA2000415%20-%20DC%20Report_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">plans<\/a> for a 5-story development that would replace part of the Old Truman brewery with offices and brand-name chain shops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, the area suffered corporate developments spreading from the richer City of London. This affected local communities with rising living costs and consequent displacement, as if the place their ancestors created took them back to their initial, mutual condition: leaving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From 1680s onwards, a large community of Protestant Huguenots fleeing from persecutions in France moved to the area. Their textile skills and the fabrics brought from cities such as Nantes and Lyon enabled the district to emerge in weaving and garment making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their religion, which finally found relief in Huguenot Church on Brick Lane, co-existed with Anglicanism professed in the nearby Christ Church on Commercial Street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two faiths were joined first by the Jewish community of Ashkenazi and Yiddish-speaking Russian Jews sheltering from the wave of anti-Semitic pogroms in 19<sup>th<\/sup>&#8211; and 20<sup>th<\/sup>-century Eastern Europe and, more recently, by a large number of Muslim Bangladeshi Bengalis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter, who left their land at the height of the war of independence from Pakistan, would work in the thriving local tailoring industry or open some of the iconic curry restaurants that even led to informally call the area \u2018Banglatown\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, bricks would keep changing their face as time went by. They would take on the colour of the graffiti that would often cover them, the scent of the fumes that would reach them from the kitchens, the taste of a pint of beer brewed in the district and spilled on the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt changed a lot,\u201d said Miah. \u201cMany of Bengalis left the area, many restaurants closed and the choice is not that diversified anymore.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.research.manchester.ac.uk\/portal\/files\/204259709\/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.research.manchester.ac.uk\/portal\/files\/204259709\/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">survey<\/a> conducted by Centre on The Dynamics of Ethnicity and Runnymede Trust to gauge the current state of Brick Lane and its ethnical diversity, 17 restaurants have closed since 2014, leaving only 22 eateries open.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, it is as if the action of building has also inherent its own contradiction. While it is true that bricks are employed to erect bridges, they are also used to raise walls, to establish watchtowers from which to flush out the enemy and, as in the case of Brick Lane, to feed the dangerous greed that might turn \u2018building\u2019 into the equivalent of \u2018demolishing\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-963\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-1600x1200.jpeg 1600w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy-1980x1485.jpeg 1980w, https:\/\/mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk\/wp\/blurr\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/31\/2022\/03\/image00003-copy.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Buildings in the City of London overshadow Brick Lane and part of Tower Hamlets.
