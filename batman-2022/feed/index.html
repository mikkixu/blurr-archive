<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/" target="_blank">The Batman</a> (2022) vocalises an un-seen characterisation of the popular DC superhero Batman and alter-ego Bruce Wayne, who has been depicted up until now as a millionaire playboy equipped only with fancy and expensive tools and mostly stripped of his intellectual independence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the murders of Gotham’s elite, &#8216;The Batman&#8217; trails alongside the perpetrator’s (the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/riddler" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/riddler" target="_blank">Riddler</a>) cryptic clues left behind at the crime scenes to unmask the villain and restore justice to the streets of Gotham. However, Batman is forced to investigate the city’s hidden corruption and question his family’s involvement. In turn, Batman’s relationship with Commissioner <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/james-gordon" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/james-gordon" target="_blank">James Gordon</a> becomes apparent, as well as the introduction to his own acquaintance with Catwoman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the audience trailed into a point of view cold open to the Riddler and his first murder, the movie already created a set-in-stone grungy, neo-noir tonality. This opening is then followed by the introduction to Batman via criminals being riddled by the fear of the shadows in a rainy dark Gotham. In turn, the audience has no other option but to feel like they are somehow committing a crime and that they should also fear the legend of the Batman themselves. This well-versed resonance feel with a comic book accurate depiction of Batman has already left the die-hard fans begging for more. His entry onto the screens following an intimidating metal clanking that could mock <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob_Marley" data-type="URL" data-id="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob_Marley" target="_blank">Marley’s</a> chains in &#8216;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol" target="_blank">A Christmas Carol</a>&#8216;, leaves us presented with our first look at the suited-up Robert Pattison’s Batman. Which of course many people have different opinions on, but of course paved the way for some amazing cinematic shots.</p>

<p>Throughout the almost 3-hour action film, we then follow this vengeance-seeking, angry, not-one to pull his punches Batman who in his own right remains angry at the corruption ruining Gotham- the same corruption that killed his parents. Matt Reeves deviated from showing the obvious popular storyline of Bruce Wayne’s parents dying and instead focuses primarily on the mental states and thought processes of Bruce Wayne and Batman, a point of view never focused on so greatly before, giving way to a whole new psychological depiction of Batman and Bruce Wayne. </p>



<p>A depiction finally giving credit to the independent intellect of Batman who no longer relies on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/alfred-pennyworth" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/alfred-pennyworth" target="_blank">Alfred’s</a> intellectual input, rather showcasing his detective skills throughout his mission to unmask the Riddler.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:240px" ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/omifua/thoughts_on_robert_pattinsons_bat_suit/">Thoughts on Robert Pattinson&#8217;s bat suit?</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DoctorCheese1/">u/DoctorCheese1</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/">batman</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Following along with the Riddler’s games we are spoon-fed increments of Batman’s personality. While we come to understand quite early on that we are watching the storyline of a younger version of batman- only 2 years since Bruce Wayne took on the role of Batman, the rage and sadness of Bruce perfectly seeps through the poker-faced Batman façade, making him arguably the most violent depiction of Batman seen on screen so far. Batman is seen beating criminals within inches of their lives multiple times on screen, the most notable being just after the final battle between Batman and the Riddler’s men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The storyline becomes tainted by Batman’s discovery of his own family’s involvement in Gotham’s corruption, sending the young superhero down a questioning spiral of his own moral values, values that he once believed made him begin fighting for all the right reasons. From here we understand the praise Robert Pattison receives for his outstanding performance as the Batman as he finally shatters the role of Batman, letting Bruce’s emotions and thoughts take over as he fears for Alfred.&nbsp;</p>

Aune on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://batman-news.com/2021/10/16/the-batman-trailer-screenshots/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://batman-news.com/2021/10/16/the-batman-trailer-screenshots/" target="_blank">Batman-news.com</a>, screenshots from &#8216;The Batman&#8217; trailers</figcaption></figure>



<p>Matt Reeves and Robert&#8217;s perfect on-screen balance between Batman’s strive for vengeance and Bruce’s yearning for companionship and approval ideally sets the film. The film perfectly captures a cinematic rebirth of Batman, this time pulling reality into the picture, also addressing the young side of Batman in great detail. Batman becomes strung along and tied in with the Riddler’s crimes, showcasing the vulnerability of the character and how much he still must learn.</p>



<p>However, whilst the main attention remains on Pattison’s performance as Batman and the future of his role as Batman, enough cannot be said about Zoe’s performance as Catwoman or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pauldanoofficial/?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/pauldanoofficial/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Dano’s</a> performance as The Riddler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reeve’s vision behind Catwoman also follows a comic book accurate anti-heroine whose relationship with Batman remains questionable. Despite Catwoman’s storyline not totally laying to rest the character&#8217;s historically twisted underpinning of a sexually charged creation, Catwoman is almost given her own legacy to avenge her mother’s and her friend’s (Annika) death and to ultimately leave Gotham. As to which, Zoe’s performance gives way for a strong female lead, leading the way for the future of Catwoman and leading by example for future female superheroes, villains, or anti-heroes within the DC universe.</p>

<p>Dano’s performance as the Riddler totally knocks <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jimcarrey__/?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/jimcarrey__/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim Carrey’s</a> comic relief depiction of the character out of the park. Although their storylines are not close to comparable, the sheer psychological torture felt by his performance almost convinces us he truly does belong in Arkham, or even a real-life mental asylum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, &#8216;The Batman&#8217; (2022) has made way for some of the most promising live-action future depictions of the superhero franchise. From a cinematic rebirth of Batman to create a more tied down realistic depiction, focusing on building the character from the bottom, starting with his mental stability, to teasers of the Joker as the next villain camo, superhero fans are in for a long, but worthwhile, wait on the edge of their seats.
