<p>The popular dating app Tinder was founded by Sean Rad in 2012. By 2014, it had an estimated one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/fashion/tinder-the-fast-growing-dating-app-taps-an-age-old-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billion</a> daily swipes. This was just the beginning of a huge cultural shift towards a digital age of dating. A world of swiping and matching was quickly born; one fuelled by a reliance on instant gratification and the chance of a quick shag, simply by clicking a few buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the invention of Tinder, many cunning entrepreneurs followed suit, eyeing up the opportunity to capitalise of us singletons’ quest for love, and an array of other dating apps were created: Hinge, Bumble, Grindr, and Thursday to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although genuine relationships have been found through dating apps, they have also become a site of disappointment, where hook-up culture is normalised. Whilst the de-stigmatisation of casual sex and pleasure undeniably has its positives, research suggests that online dating could be negatively affecting our experiences of love, sex, and intimacy, as physcotherapist Andrea Freira<em> </em>explains how and why our emotional needs might not be being met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s Friday night and I’m getting ready for a date with a guy I’ve matched on Hinge. He looked perfectly normal. Attractive. Nice eyes and smile. Good dress sense. His profile had the right ratio of selfies and pictures with friends and family, confirming he wasn’t a serial killer. We chatted for a couple of days and seemed to have a lot in common, so decided to go to the pub.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now six pints, a hangover, and a ghost later, I’m wondering where it all went wrong. If you’re fortunate enough to not know what ghosting is, the urban dictionary coins it as, “a person cutting off all communication with zero warning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That week, the front room of my shared house was host to many feminist chats, with me the angry ringleader. I was consoled by the girls that of course, this was his loss; that there was nothing wrong with me. However, it wasn’t insecurity or fear of rejection that was niggling at me. I was genuinely confused by the online dating world and the lies that seemed to accompany it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a newly single person, I was totally unfamiliar with the convoluted subtext that came with dating. “I’d love to take you on another date” seems to translate as “You will literally never hear from me again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m not the only one. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/" target="_blank">study</a> directed by the Pew Research Centre found that 45% of online daters were left feeling frustrated by the experience, compared with a mere 28% that felt hopeful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could we, Gen Z, be quite literally fucked?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are the generation that have grown up with an endless pool of options, in all aspects of life. Netflix presents us with a dizzying array of entertainment, where the maximum effort required is moving your fingers to remote. To accompany our movie night, we click a few buttons, and a McDonalds magically appears at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="697" height="392" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-525" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg 697w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><figcaption>Popular dating app, Tinder. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The notion of minimum input, maximum output, has unfortunately trickled into our love lives. As 19-year-old Tinder-user <em>Honor Newman</em> explains: “One of the issues with dating apps is that it’s so easy to find somebody. You don’t have to put it any effort. It’s not a chase, it’s just there you go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The art of communication is being lost in translation. When singles enter the online dating world and meet their match, there is no blueprint stating how serious a connection that person is looking for. (Unless of course, they write it on their profile, which is a rarity.) “I think more men use Tinder for a quick shag, to just have sex with lots of different people really easily,” says Newman. “Women aren’t necessarily just looking for sex, we actually want to find somebody.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When two people are online dating with different intentions and not communicating, problems can arise. Communication issues can of course also occur in same-sex relationships, but psycho-therapist Andrea Freira explains the part gender roles play when it comes to heterosexual dating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The male and female brains are wired differently, so biologically speaking we are different, women are a lot more attuned with their emotional side. Men often go into dating with less expectations and that’s sometimes where the conflict occurs, as men are perhaps just looking to get to know you and are typically a lot harder to get to commit to a relationship than women are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a vast majority of men are using these apps just to find different sexual partners, it’s no wonder emotional connections and meaningful relationships are not being found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that occurs when using dating apps is the immense build-up. Often, when you match with someone online, you start to create an idea of that person in your head, creating a false narrative of what you think they’re like – or, what you want them to be like. This is where meeting a potential partner in person, as opposed to on a dating app, could be more beneficial. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you are meeting someone in real life you can use your intuition to guide you, whereas when you are engaging or getting to know someone online there is always an expectation,” Freira explains. “Usually, people go into online dating with an outcome in their mind. Whereas as if you were able to go into it just looking to know that person and experience that person, without any expectation of an outcome it could be a lot more fulfilling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, perhaps it’s not all doom and gloom. Perhaps it’s about actively changing our mindsets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-575" width="610" height="406" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1600x1065.jpg 1600w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1200x799.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1980x1318.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>Image provided by Unsplash</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is </strong><strong>still </strong><strong>hope.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the many of us still single and exasperated online-daters, there are a notable number of couples whose modern love-stories began at the swipe of a finger. According to The Future of Dating <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eharmony.co.uk/dating-advice/dating/the-future-of-dating-report-2018-smart-devices-to-predict-if-your-relationship-is-on-the-rocks/" target="_blank">report</a> by The Imperial College Business School and eHarmony, 32% of relationships that started between 2015 and 2019 met online, and by 2035 they estimate that more than 50% of couples will have met through online dating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is 21-year-old *Katie Thomas* who met her now boyfriend on Hinge. After over a year on the app with no luck and a string of unsuccessful matches, she explains how this time was different.&nbsp; &#8220;He made it clear from the get-go what he wanted. There was no messing around, there was no game playing,&#8221; she says. Communication was key from the offset. “There was consistent effort on his part, which gave me the space to also put effort in and be honest without feeling silly or feeling like it wasn’t going to go anywhere.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer could be in the way we approach online-dating and the kind of communication we use. As Freira says, “It can work if two people can go into it with the right mindset and allow things to develop and really enjoy getting to know the other person. Go into it with an open mind and don’t attach yourselves to any potential outcome. Just allow it to just flow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making a conscious effort to have no pre-conceptions about your match while being communicative and honest from the beginning, could be key in using dating apps to your full advantage, and not hurting anyone else in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><em>As the pandemic reshaped our conception of love and relationships, the words of American author bell hooks are more prevalent than ever. </em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-primary-color has-text-color">As I sit down at my dining table a week from spending another Valentine’s alone, listening to the gospel of Eric Clapton, I can’t help but wonder: was bell hooks right? Is young culture today cynical about love? Are we really creating a culture of 20 something un-romantics who can name the strangest of kinks, but cringe at the thought of love?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2000, the book <em>All About Love: New Visions</em> had explored love in modern society. Twenty-two years later, amid post-covid and digital love youth,&nbsp;the&nbsp;work remains current. GenZers&nbsp;have found a false sense of comfort in a culture of hook-ups, instant gratification, cynicism and isolation. Was bell hooks right, are we too cynical to truly love?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being young is hard. In the face of a looming climate crisis, flop governments and post-covid anxiety, it is not a surprise that love is tough to find. Young people are letting go of the quest for love and intimacy, as bell hooks says ahead of her time: cynicism is the great mask of the disappointed and betrayed heart. </p>



<p>We are a generation whose connection to love has been warped by hook-up culture, sex-orientated TV shows, dating app companies which thrive on loneliness and two whole years of almost pure isolation. So, I joined&nbsp;a group of GenZers, Tristan (19), Tasia (19), Karis (20) and Kiera (19), who were ready to explore their own ideas and connection to loving whilst young. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Five young individuals gathered with two bottles of wine between us wondering and delving into the effects of being without love. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“<strong>That shit [love] is gone, there is nowhere to meet people organically, everyone is just trying to fuck,” said Tristan.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It’s a lonely world out there for GenZers, especially those who don’t partake in hook-up culture. Even non-romantic love is a struggle, with social media becoming our ever-present judge on our image, education and careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are more focused on how we stand in a capitalist world than building communities and long-lasting relationships. “It’s not just romantic love that is lost, it’s also self-love. Everyone is too cynical,” says 20-year-old Karis, “Social media and growing cynicism is not only damaging our love lives, but also the love that we have for ourselves.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most young people aren’t even comfortable speaking about love. It is easier to get young people to speak about favourite sex positions than to get them to tell their friends ‘I love you.’ &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can speak about love but only in my inner circles,” says Tristan, who easily told me about his&nbsp;sexual encounters, but stuttered when trying to define love. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a generation that is studious when it comes to sex positivity but emotionally stunted at the topic of love: it is no surprise that young people have essentially dropped out of the race for love. It requires commitment, longevity and truthfulness. But who could blame us , when social media companies have shaped dating into a swift finger motion of purely aestheticism and desirability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is it even possible to commit when you are just a three second image on a person’s smart phone? Instant gratification over long-term commitment defines our generation. Food deliveries instead of cooking, next-day shipping and seven-second TikTok videos. All life changing conveniences: the prize of the modern world, a double-edged sword that corrupts our attention spans and willingness to commit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every one of my interviewees were on dating apps. Their faces looked disappointed when I asked the dreaded question, which we all know well, ‘Have you found someone?’&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiera, the only one who has been in a relationship (for 4 and a half years,) described them as ‘a chore.’&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t feel like love is lost amongst young people, deep down it is what majority of us want,” she said with such hopefulness that maybe only someone in a loving relationship could conceive. Her and her boyfriend were high-school sweethearts, their&nbsp;love was organic, and their brains still uncorrupted by the anti-love tech giants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there, it can be possible for young people to commit to love. Kiera’s testimony gives us a momentary glimmer into the idea of love still existing in our culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then comes Covid-19, two years of isolation and complete digital submergence, it feels like if any of us had hope for putting ourselves out there, it was all out of the window. Isolation physically stopped us from interacting and making long-term intimate connections. </p>



<p>“Quarantine made me feel more comfortable with the idea of being by myself,” says Tasia, as the energy of the group simmered down as the wine was reaching an end. “It doesn’t seem like there is any time to build a whole new intimate relationship” and&nbsp;the idea of committing to a new relationship, as the world around you is reaching Armageddon, seems like a prison sentence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Life feels like it’s slipping fast. According to Tristan, “Relationships seem like they always have an inevitable ending”. In a post-pandemic world where we were cruelly shown that we have no control over our lives, young people want stability and comfort in things that aren’t as big of a gamble as relationships seem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To love or not to love, that is the question. There are many ways of looking at it. bell hooks tells us to love, as a generous heart is always open. American actress&nbsp;Jenny Slate says she would rather live with a tender heart, for it is the key to finding love. Eric Clapton sings “You just don’t realise how much I love you”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Love and loving are natural to human existence. The very first thing we do as we enter the world is love, as we are held by our mothers and see their loving eyes for the first time, all the way until we lay on our death bed and have the loves of our lives flash before our eyes as the very last thing we do. As young people we shouldn’t lose all hope on finding love. As the leaders of the world to come, building our communities on all things encompassing love should be a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
