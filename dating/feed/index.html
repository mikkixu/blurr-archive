<p>The popular dating app Tinder was founded by Sean Rad in 2012. By 2014, it had an estimated one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/fashion/tinder-the-fast-growing-dating-app-taps-an-age-old-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billion</a> daily swipes. This was just the beginning of a huge cultural shift towards a digital age of dating. A world of swiping and matching was quickly born; one fuelled by a reliance on instant gratification and the chance of a quick shag, simply by clicking a few buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the invention of Tinder, many cunning entrepreneurs followed suit, eyeing up the opportunity to capitalise of us singletons’ quest for love, and an array of other dating apps were created: Hinge, Bumble, Grindr, and Thursday to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although genuine relationships have been found through dating apps, they have also become a site of disappointment, where hook-up culture is normalised. Whilst the de-stigmatisation of casual sex and pleasure undeniably has its positives, research suggests that online dating could be negatively affecting our experiences of love, sex, and intimacy, as physcotherapist Andrea Freira<em> </em>explains how and why our emotional needs might not be being met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s Friday night and I’m getting ready for a date with a guy I’ve matched on Hinge. He looked perfectly normal. Attractive. Nice eyes and smile. Good dress sense. His profile had the right ratio of selfies and pictures with friends and family, confirming he wasn’t a serial killer. We chatted for a couple of days and seemed to have a lot in common, so decided to go to the pub.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now six pints, a hangover, and a ghost later, I’m wondering where it all went wrong. If you’re fortunate enough to not know what ghosting is, the urban dictionary coins it as, “a person cutting off all communication with zero warning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That week, the front room of my shared house was host to many feminist chats, with me the angry ringleader. I was consoled by the girls that of course, this was his loss; that there was nothing wrong with me. However, it wasn’t insecurity or fear of rejection that was niggling at me. I was genuinely confused by the online dating world and the lies that seemed to accompany it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a newly single person, I was totally unfamiliar with the convoluted subtext that came with dating. “I’d love to take you on another date” seems to translate as “You will literally never hear from me again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m not the only one. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/" target="_blank">study</a> directed by the Pew Research Centre found that 45% of online daters were left feeling frustrated by the experience, compared with a mere 28% that felt hopeful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could we, Gen Z, be quite literally fucked?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are the generation that have grown up with an endless pool of options, in all aspects of life. Netflix presents us with a dizzying array of entertainment, where the maximum effort required is moving your fingers to remote. To accompany our movie night, we click a few buttons, and a McDonalds magically appears at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="697" height="392" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-525" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg 697w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><figcaption>Popular dating app, Tinder. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The notion of minimum input, maximum output, has unfortunately trickled into our love lives. As 19-year-old Tinder-user <em>Honor Newman</em> explains: “One of the issues with dating apps is that it’s so easy to find somebody. You don’t have to put it any effort. It’s not a chase, it’s just there you go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The art of communication is being lost in translation. When singles enter the online dating world and meet their match, there is no blueprint stating how serious a connection that person is looking for. (Unless of course, they write it on their profile, which is a rarity.) “I think more men use Tinder for a quick shag, to just have sex with lots of different people really easily,” says Newman. “Women aren’t necessarily just looking for sex, we actually want to find somebody.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When two people are online dating with different intentions and not communicating, problems can arise. Communication issues can of course also occur in same-sex relationships, but psycho-therapist Andrea Freira explains the part gender roles play when it comes to heterosexual dating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The male and female brains are wired differently, so biologically speaking we are different, women are a lot more attuned with their emotional side. Men often go into dating with less expectations and that’s sometimes where the conflict occurs, as men are perhaps just looking to get to know you and are typically a lot harder to get to commit to a relationship than women are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a vast majority of men are using these apps just to find different sexual partners, it’s no wonder emotional connections and meaningful relationships are not being found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that occurs when using dating apps is the immense build-up. Often, when you match with someone online, you start to create an idea of that person in your head, creating a false narrative of what you think they’re like – or, what you want them to be like. This is where meeting a potential partner in person, as opposed to on a dating app, could be more beneficial. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you are meeting someone in real life you can use your intuition to guide you, whereas when you are engaging or getting to know someone online there is always an expectation,” Freira explains. “Usually, people go into online dating with an outcome in their mind. Whereas as if you were able to go into it just looking to know that person and experience that person, without any expectation of an outcome it could be a lot more fulfilling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, perhaps it’s not all doom and gloom. Perhaps it’s about actively changing our mindsets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>There is </strong><strong>still </strong><strong>hope.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the many of us still single and exasperated online-daters, there are a notable number of couples whose modern love-stories began at the swipe of a finger. According to The Future of Dating <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eharmony.co.uk/dating-advice/dating/the-future-of-dating-report-2018-smart-devices-to-predict-if-your-relationship-is-on-the-rocks/" target="_blank">report</a> by The Imperial College Business School and eHarmony, 32% of relationships that started between 2015 and 2019 met online, and by 2035 they estimate that more than 50% of couples will have met through online dating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is 21-year-old *Katie Thomas* who met her now boyfriend on Hinge. After over a year on the app with no luck and a string of unsuccessful matches, she explains how this time was different.&nbsp; &#8220;He made it clear from the get-go what he wanted. There was no messing around, there was no game playing,&#8221; she says. Communication was key from the offset. “There was consistent effort on his part, which gave me the space to also put effort in and be honest without feeling silly or feeling like it wasn’t going to go anywhere.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer could be in the way we approach online-dating and the kind of communication we use. As Freira says, “It can work if two people can go into it with the right mindset and allow things to develop and really enjoy getting to know the other person. Go into it with an open mind and don’t attach yourselves to any potential outcome. Just allow it to just flow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making a conscious effort to have no pre-conceptions about your match while being communicative and honest from the beginning, could be key in using dating apps to your full advantage, and not hurting anyone else in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deriving from the sixth season of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.itv.com/loveisland" target="_blank">“Love Island”</a>&nbsp;U.K., the “ick” hit social media by storm, making everyone question what our “icks” are. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The unofficial term, by <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=sarahchasauce" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=sarahchasauce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarahchsauce</a> on Urban dictionary, defines an “ick” as “something someone does that is an instant turn-off for you, making you instantly hate the idea of being with them romantically”. But the “ick” goes deeper than just a sexual turn off, with those feeling the “ick” left to pick up the pieces of a now broken attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may be wondering if you ever felt an “ick” and whether they are really that serious. Well, let us all get into a pair of hypothetical shoes: you are on a wonderful date with a steaming hot guy (or girl), they open all the doors for you, lead an amazing conversation. You even start to think there is a second date upon the horizon when suddenly, they make that one move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;I said i got the ick&#8230; maybe I&#8217;m being too harsh&#8221; </p><cite><a href="https://www.instagram.com/priyagopaldas/?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/priyagopaldas/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Priya Gopaldas</a> on Love Island 2021 (Video Below).</cite></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Can An &#8220;Ick&#8221; Be?</h2>



<p>“Icks” are a very subjective discussion. Perhaps, they took a drink from a glass and all you could notice was their mouth open, chugging that water down through the glass. Or maybe they said <em>Mayonnaise</em> like “man-aze” or, all of a sudden, you picture them running up the stairs on all fours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An “ick” is something that personally makes any possibility of a second date or some form of attraction, whether that is mental or sexual depleted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Do &#8220;Icks&#8221; Mean?</h2>



<p>Apart from the unofficial Urban Dictionary definition, what do “icks” mean when they happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could say “icks” ultimately save us from a failed marriage. “The ick is different to just doubting whether you want to be with somebody,” said Gurpreet Singh in an <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a30699470/the-ick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with Cosmopolitan. “The ick is much more repulsive. It is a very strong gut reaction.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Our body essentially gives us a warning sign that it is not meant to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of your date saying Mayonnaise like “man-aze” however, it could just be a friendly reminder that there are some things that will irritate you about this person. Which is normal!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are ‘ick’s important?</h2>



<p>Just how ‘icks’ are subjective to personal standards, whether they are important or not is down to how you feel. Will the way they say something, do something or not do something be a deal-breaker or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, some cases are more extreme than others. Someone not washing their hands before eating or chewing with their mouth open may be a deal-breaker for most of us but, pronunciation may not be the end of the world for most of us.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can Some &#8220;icks&#8221; be Ridiculous?</h2>



<p>Usually, when things go viral online, they get blown way out of proportion. The topic of the “ick” is no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From getting the “ick” because he used a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shxtsngigs/video/7042324235494149382" target="_blank">chocolate box menu to pick a chocolate from a selection box</a> to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shxtsngigs/video/7047521143514795269" target="_blank">sitting in the wrong seat at a cinema and getting told to move</a>, there are sometimes silly agreements on what an “ick” can be. But really, no “ick” is ridiculous! We feel what we feel, and we get the “ick” because we got an “ick”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is There a Silver Lining?</h2>



<p>While “icks” are subjective, there is no doubt we all get them. Although this may be a revolutionary discovery, men also get them. The unseen benefit is that we are, once again, all in the same boat! It is okay to get them, as &#8220;icks” are part of being human.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussions around our “icks” going viral online not only have sparked up a conversation between people agreeing and disagreeing, but they have also led to a lot of us being educated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, someone who had an “ick” over sweating may learn that there are certain diseases such as hyperhidrosis, which a person who sweats abnormally might suffer from.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forums, such as our Reddit post below, are great places to discuss your own “icks”, find out new ones and become more educated. What do you think? Do &#8220;icks&#8221; really have a silver lining?</p>
