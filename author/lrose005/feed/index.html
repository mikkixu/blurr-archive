<p>The popular dating app Tinder was founded by Sean Rad in 2012. By 2014, it had an estimated one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/fashion/tinder-the-fast-growing-dating-app-taps-an-age-old-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billion</a> daily swipes. This was just the beginning of a huge cultural shift towards a digital age of dating. A world of swiping and matching was quickly born; one fuelled by a reliance on instant gratification and the chance of a quick shag, simply by clicking a few buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the invention of Tinder, many cunning entrepreneurs followed suit, eyeing up the opportunity to capitalise of us singletons’ quest for love, and an array of other dating apps were created: Hinge, Bumble, Grindr, and Thursday to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although genuine relationships have been found through dating apps, they have also become a site of disappointment, where hook-up culture is normalised. Whilst the de-stigmatisation of casual sex and pleasure undeniably has its positives, research suggests that online dating could be negatively affecting our experiences of love, sex, and intimacy, as physcotherapist Andrea Freira<em> </em>explains how and why our emotional needs might not be being met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s Friday night and I’m getting ready for a date with a guy I’ve matched on Hinge. He looked perfectly normal. Attractive. Nice eyes and smile. Good dress sense. His profile had the right ratio of selfies and pictures with friends and family, confirming he wasn’t a serial killer. We chatted for a couple of days and seemed to have a lot in common, so decided to go to the pub.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now six pints, a hangover, and a ghost later, I’m wondering where it all went wrong. If you’re fortunate enough to not know what ghosting is, the urban dictionary coins it as, “a person cutting off all communication with zero warning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That week, the front room of my shared house was host to many feminist chats, with me the angry ringleader. I was consoled by the girls that of course, this was his loss; that there was nothing wrong with me. However, it wasn’t insecurity or fear of rejection that was niggling at me. I was genuinely confused by the online dating world and the lies that seemed to accompany it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a newly single person, I was totally unfamiliar with the convoluted subtext that came with dating. “I’d love to take you on another date” seems to translate as “You will literally never hear from me again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m not the only one. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/" target="_blank">study</a> directed by the Pew Research Centre found that 45% of online daters were left feeling frustrated by the experience, compared with a mere 28% that felt hopeful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could we, Gen Z, be quite literally fucked?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are the generation that have grown up with an endless pool of options, in all aspects of life. Netflix presents us with a dizzying array of entertainment, where the maximum effort required is moving your fingers to remote. To accompany our movie night, we click a few buttons, and a McDonalds magically appears at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="697" height="392" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-525" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg 697w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><figcaption>Popular dating app, Tinder. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The notion of minimum input, maximum output, has unfortunately trickled into our love lives. As 19-year-old Tinder-user <em>Honor Newman</em> explains: “One of the issues with dating apps is that it’s so easy to find somebody. You don’t have to put it any effort. It’s not a chase, it’s just there you go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The art of communication is being lost in translation. When singles enter the online dating world and meet their match, there is no blueprint stating how serious a connection that person is looking for. (Unless of course, they write it on their profile, which is a rarity.) “I think more men use Tinder for a quick shag, to just have sex with lots of different people really easily,” says Newman. “Women aren’t necessarily just looking for sex, we actually want to find somebody.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When two people are online dating with different intentions and not communicating, problems can arise. Communication issues can of course also occur in same-sex relationships, but psycho-therapist Andrea Freira explains the part gender roles play when it comes to heterosexual dating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The male and female brains are wired differently, so biologically speaking we are different, women are a lot more attuned with their emotional side. Men often go into dating with less expectations and that’s sometimes where the conflict occurs, as men are perhaps just looking to get to know you and are typically a lot harder to get to commit to a relationship than women are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a vast majority of men are using these apps just to find different sexual partners, it’s no wonder emotional connections and meaningful relationships are not being found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that occurs when using dating apps is the immense build-up. Often, when you match with someone online, you start to create an idea of that person in your head, creating a false narrative of what you think they’re like – or, what you want them to be like. This is where meeting a potential partner in person, as opposed to on a dating app, could be more beneficial. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you are meeting someone in real life you can use your intuition to guide you, whereas when you are engaging or getting to know someone online there is always an expectation,” Freira explains. “Usually, people go into online dating with an outcome in their mind. Whereas as if you were able to go into it just looking to know that person and experience that person, without any expectation of an outcome it could be a lot more fulfilling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, perhaps it’s not all doom and gloom. Perhaps it’s about actively changing our mindsets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-575" width="610" height="406" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1600x1065.jpg 1600w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1200x799.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/love-art-edited-1-1980x1318.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>Image provided by Unsplash</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is </strong><strong>still </strong><strong>hope.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the many of us still single and exasperated online-daters, there are a notable number of couples whose modern love-stories began at the swipe of a finger. According to The Future of Dating <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eharmony.co.uk/dating-advice/dating/the-future-of-dating-report-2018-smart-devices-to-predict-if-your-relationship-is-on-the-rocks/" target="_blank">report</a> by The Imperial College Business School and eHarmony, 32% of relationships that started between 2015 and 2019 met online, and by 2035 they estimate that more than 50% of couples will have met through online dating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is 21-year-old *Katie Thomas* who met her now boyfriend on Hinge. After over a year on the app with no luck and a string of unsuccessful matches, she explains how this time was different.&nbsp; &#8220;He made it clear from the get-go what he wanted. There was no messing around, there was no game playing,&#8221; she says. Communication was key from the offset. “There was consistent effort on his part, which gave me the space to also put effort in and be honest without feeling silly or feeling like it wasn’t going to go anywhere.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer could be in the way we approach online-dating and the kind of communication we use. As Freira says, “It can work if two people can go into it with the right mindset and allow things to develop and really enjoy getting to know the other person. Go into it with an open mind and don’t attach yourselves to any potential outcome. Just allow it to just flow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making a conscious effort to have no pre-conceptions about your match while being communicative and honest from the beginning, could be key in using dating apps to your full advantage, and not hurting anyone else in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Learn to love the skin you&#8217;re in, without having to change it.</strong></em></p>



<p>When you google acne, a million and one websites appear selling treatments and products that promise to miraculously clear your skin. Drink four litres of water every day, sleep with silk pillowcases, shot apple cider vinegar every morning and spend thousands on chemical peels. </p>



<p>The information comes at you from every angle, and it can be extremely overwhelming. Not to mention that they’re usually based off no factual data or scientific evidence.</p>



<p>Having suffered with acne for the last six years of my life, I have felt the desperation that led me to try all these tips and tricks off random women on the internet. None of which worked.</p>



<p>Since I was 16, I have tried multiple medications, treatments, and home remedies and despite all of this I still have acne. At times it really improves. Then out of nowhere new spots appear, and my confidence plummets back down to below zero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cycle continues.</p>



<p>Now at 22, after the hard realisation that the acne isn’t going anywhere just yet, I had to change the way I viewed myself. For my mental health’s sake, I have done a lot of work on my inner-self, and I now spend less time trying and failing to ‘fix’ my skin.</p>



<p>Instead, I have learnt to love the skin I’m in, regardless of its appearance. As contrary to popular belief, we don’t have that much control over the appearance of our skin. But we can control our mindset.</p>



<p>Here are some simple steps to help change the way you view yourself and your skin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Try and Go Makeup Free</u></strong></p>



<p>I know the thought may seem daunting. I really struggle to leave the house without makeup, especially when my acne has flared up particularly badly. Makeup serves as a safety blanket, and concealer my best friend. When I’ve covered my face with a thick layer of paint, I can be blemish free, and I instantly feel more confident.</p>



<p>I know that feeling of insecurities creeping in all too well. &nbsp;It can make the thought of heading out the door bare faced seem almost impossible, even if you are just popping to Tesco. You worry that everyone will be looking at your skin, viewing you as unattractive or even dirty.</p>



<p>To unlearn that clear skin equals beautiful, I try to go make-up free some days, to find my confidence from within. One day this week, I challenge you to try it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll go first.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/acne-final-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-600" width="611" height="611"/><figcaption>Personal Image</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Do Not Avoid Socialising</u></strong></p>



<p>Socialising can be really anxiety provoking when you have acne. I can remember quite a few times I have said no to seeing my friends because my skin was having a flare up. I was worried about what people might think of me.</p>



<p>One Saturday night a few years ago and I was getting ready to go out with my friends. I put concealer on, then foundation. Then powder. More powder. Nothing would cover my spots. I looked in the mirror and all I could see was my acne.</p>



<p>I was so exhausted and angry. I scrubbed at my face with a wipe, until the makeup was all off. I was about to start re-applying but with a heavier foundation this time when I caught my reflection in the mirror.</p>



<p>I gave up, and I didn’t go out. I was so worried that all people would look at was my acne. I missed out on a night of drinking, dancing, and making memories with my friends. I regret all the times I cancelled plans because I was insecure about my skin.</p>



<p>In reality no-one is even looking, let alone judging.</p>



<p>So, go out and have fun. Don’t let your skin get in the way of your life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Filter Who You Follow</u></strong></p>



<p>Social media can be a toxic place. Scrolling all day on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok is unsurprisingly bad for our mental health. But if you suffer with acne, it can be even worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of filters and airbrushing creates a false narrative that everyone, everywhere, has ‘perfect’ skin.</p>



<p>No spots. No skin texture. Just smooth, glowing, tanned blemish-free faces.</p>



<p>Social media is lying to us all.</p>



<p>Constantly seeing ‘perfect’ skin every time you open the app can be really difficult for people who suffer with skin problems. So, if Instagram is making you feel insecure, it might be useful to have a re-think of who you follow.</p>



<p>Go through the accounts on your feed and ask yourself, ‘Does this person make me feel good or bad about myself?’ If the answer is bad, you know what to do.</p>



<p>There are also lots of skin positive accounts on Instagram, where people share their journey with acne. Following these has really helped me find my confidence. It’s refreshing to see selfies with spots, scarring and skin texture. It reminds you that you are not alone, and that acne is much more common than you might think.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Positive Skin Affirmations</u></strong></p>



<p>When my skin is bad, I sometimes find myself looking in the mirror and speaking so negatively about myself in my head.</p>



<p>‘Your acne is back.’ ‘You look disgusting.’ ‘You need to cover up your skin.’</p>



<p>I grasped what I was doing, and realised I needed to change this. Why am I putting myself down? If one of my friends had acne, would I say this to them? After asking myself these questions, I realised that I needed to start using positive affirmations instead.</p>



<p>Now, when I look I the mirror, particularly if I am having a bad skin day, I start my morning with some positive affirmations.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, I know saying affirmations isn’t going to change my skin or confidence overnight. But, if you are consistent with them, it can have a hugely positive effect on your self-esteem and thinking pattern.</p>



<p>Positive affirmations are a way of actively swapping a negative mindset for a positive one.&nbsp; For example, if I’m feeling insecure about my acne I might say, ‘I feel happy in my skin.’</p>



<p>Here are some skin affirmations you can try:</p>



<p>My skin is beautiful.</p>



<p>My skin protects me.</p>



<p>My skin is healing.</p>



<p>I am becoming more comfortable with my imperfections.</p>



<p>My skin does not define me.</p>
