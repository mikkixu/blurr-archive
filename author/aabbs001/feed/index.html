<p>Deriving from the sixth season of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.itv.com/loveisland" target="_blank">“Love Island”</a>&nbsp;U.K., the “ick” hit social media by storm, making everyone question what our “icks” are. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The unofficial term, by <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=sarahchasauce" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=sarahchasauce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarahchsauce</a> on Urban dictionary, defines an “ick” as “something someone does that is an instant turn-off for you, making you instantly hate the idea of being with them romantically”. But the “ick” goes deeper than just a sexual turn off, with those feeling the “ick” left to pick up the pieces of a now broken attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may be wondering if you ever felt an “ick” and whether they are really that serious. Well, let us all get into a pair of hypothetical shoes: you are on a wonderful date with a steaming hot guy (or girl), they open all the doors for you, lead an amazing conversation. You even start to think there is a second date upon the horizon when suddenly, they make that one move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Can An &#8220;Ick&#8221; Be?</h2>



<p>“Icks” are a very subjective discussion. Perhaps, they took a drink from a glass and all you could notice was their mouth open, chugging that water down through the glass. Or maybe they said <em>Mayonnaise</em> like “man-aze” or, all of a sudden, you picture them running up the stairs on all fours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An “ick” is something that personally makes any possibility of a second date or some form of attraction, whether that is mental or sexual depleted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Do &#8220;Icks&#8221; Mean?</h2>



<p>Apart from the unofficial Urban Dictionary definition, what do “icks” mean when they happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could say “icks” ultimately save us from a failed marriage. “The ick is different to just doubting whether you want to be with somebody,” said Gurpreet Singh in an <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a30699470/the-ick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with Cosmopolitan. “The ick is much more repulsive. It is a very strong gut reaction.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Our body essentially gives us a warning sign that it is not meant to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of your date saying Mayonnaise like “man-aze” however, it could just be a friendly reminder that there are some things that will irritate you about this person. Which is normal!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are ‘ick’s important?</h2>



<p>Just how ‘icks’ are subjective to personal standards, whether they are important or not is down to how you feel. Will the way they say something, do something or not do something be a deal-breaker or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, some cases are more extreme than others. Someone not washing their hands before eating or chewing with their mouth open may be a deal-breaker for most of us but, pronunciation may not be the end of the world for most of us.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can Some &#8220;icks&#8221; be Ridiculous?</h2>



<p>Usually, when things go viral online, they get blown way out of proportion. The topic of the “ick” is no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From getting the “ick” because he used a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shxtsngigs/video/7042324235494149382" target="_blank">chocolate box menu to pick a chocolate from a selection box</a> to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shxtsngigs/video/7047521143514795269" target="_blank">sitting in the wrong seat at a cinema and getting told to move</a>, there are sometimes silly agreements on what an “ick” can be. But really, no “ick” is ridiculous! We feel what we feel, and we get the “ick” because we got an “ick”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/mindfulness-g369578183_1280-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-423" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/mindfulness-g369578183_1280-1024x512.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/mindfulness-g369578183_1280-300x150.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/mindfulness-g369578183_1280-768x384.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/mindfulness-g369578183_1280-1200x600.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/mindfulness-g369578183_1280.png 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image provided by <a href="https://pixabay.com/vectors/mindfulness-brain-heart-mind-body-5371476/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pixabay.com/vectors/mindfulness-brain-heart-mind-body-5371476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDJ on Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is There a Silver Lining?</h2>



<p>While “icks” are subjective, there is no doubt we all get them. Although this may be a revolutionary discovery, men also get them. The unseen benefit is that we are, once again, all in the same boat! It is okay to get them, as &#8220;icks” are part of being human.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussions around our “icks” going viral online not only have sparked up a conversation between people agreeing and disagreeing, but they have also led to a lot of us being educated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, someone who had an “ick” over sweating may learn that there are certain diseases such as hyperhidrosis, which a person who sweats abnormally might suffer from.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forums, such as our Reddit post below, are great places to discuss your own “icks”, find out new ones and become more educated. What do you think? Do &#8220;icks&#8221; really have a silver lining?</p>

<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">We all want more money, right? That is exactly what we have seen online with Cryptocurrency making people millions. But does it work? And how hard is it?</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Since the beginning of Decentralized (DeFi) cryptocurrency in 2009, with the creation of Bitcoin, the ‘crypto-verse’ has taken the online world by storm. Despite financial institutions, such as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk" target="_blank">Bank of England</a>, warning investors to be prepared to lose all their money, it is estimated that around <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCtYOYhOf2AhVRZcAKHa7nBMQQFnoECAUQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcybercrew.uk%2Fblog%2Fcryptocurrency-statistics-uk%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gk1YE58ULO1DfsuKyGhn_" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCtYOYhOf2AhVRZcAKHa7nBMQQFnoECAUQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcybercrew.uk%2Fblog%2Fcryptocurrency-statistics-uk%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gk1YE58ULO1DfsuKyGhn_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.8 million</a> people in the U.K. hold some sort of Cryptocurrency as of February 2021.</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Alongside the rise in interest towards NFT’s (Non-fungible token), even those who don’t invest in cryptocurrency have heard all about it, and the possible rewards that come with investing. From social media trends surrounding ‘<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dogecoin.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dogecoin.com" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a>’ to headlines from an ex-McDonald’s worker to a crypto millionaire, cryptocurrency has certainly gained a lot of interest, especially among younger generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Despite his initial fears of “losing money and investing in bad projects”, he said that investing into cryptocurrency has made him “more financially stable and more aware of how he spends his money”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially being introduced to cryptocurrency back in 2014 and looking it up online he “wasn’t really interested”. However, after the upward trend in cryptocurrency being seen as a get-rich-quick scheme, Kone decided to invest. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Introduced after the 2008 financial crash many consider cryptocurrency to be a “true innovation on money,” such as David, a representative for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://titano.finance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://titano.finance/" target="_blank">Titano Finance</a> and the Titano community.  “Cryptocurrency is an industry that utilises a particular type of technology to create value.  Money gets its value by all of us agreeing that something is worth something”.  </p>

<p>Titano is a ‘DeFi’ token that launched in November 2021 and is the first of its kind, making use of its ‘Titano Autostaking Protocol’ (TAP) makes “staking easier and gives TITANO token holders the highest stable returns in crypto” via rebase rewards.</p>



<p>People “want to claim their full value from the financial system,” said David. “We’ve been so used to settling for what we have, and we live in a society that believes in the scarcity principle: if I have it, you can’t have it, so I gotta keep it from you,&#8221; a principle cryptocurrency offers a way out from.</p>



<p>According to Titano, their coin “provides platforms, tools and guidance so each of our investors and partners can learn and participate and profit from it”, proving the &#8216;crypto-verse&#8217; to possibly not be as volatile as one would believe and friendlier for the new investors. </p>



<p>With many young people finding cryptocurrency hard to navigate, “we need more creators willing to create straight forward introductions into the scene&#8221;,  which is why auto-staking or rebase tokens such as Titano’s make investing in cryptocurrency easy, taking by “the learning curve down to zero.&#8221;</p>

<p>Titano is a community-run rebase token. This means that “the supply of the token is increased or decreased algorithmically, based on the current price of each token”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Titano makes use of this formula to “increase the token supply, allowing  Titano holders to keep growing their tokens” and therefore, making profit from the money they put into the coin. “It’s a grand experiment. I want to give power to the people,” said David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency can often feel like a gamble. “The scammers are very motivated, very smart and come up with ways that you know, you just thought you had no idea was possible,” said David. Titano team members, like many other cryptocurrency teams, remain anonymous, which can often deter many from investing. However, he thinks that anonymity provides a sense of security, not only to the team members but to users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked why the Titano team remain anonymous despite fears held by investors, he said that doxing “is typically done so you can verify who it is that you are dealing with. There is much better ways to protect yourself than having someone’s name or ‘linkedin’ which could also be faked.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Come in and spend some time, get to know the space. See if you like it. Ask the tough questions. Do your research. Read the <a href="https://docs.titano.finance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://docs.titano.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">white paper</a>, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzp4XQqxucZ-R7TgT-Ug3pg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzp4XQqxucZ-R7TgT-Ug3pg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMA’s</a> and see what we do,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sean Edwards, a 20-year-old Titano investor, first started investing in cryptocurrency in March 2021. He was inspired by “the incentive to make amounts of money that would have taken me years to make using traditional methods,<strong>”</strong> adding that “better APR rates” makes cryptocurrency more appealing than mainstream banking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He stated that cryptocurrency is totally worth it but “only if you’re willing to do your own research and accept that you don’t know it all”. Going on to add that you shouldn’t “invest more than you’re willing to lose.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Like David, Edwards believes that the anonymity associated with the &#8216;DeFi&#8217; side of cryptocurrency is a positive. “I like that I&#8217;m able to invest privately. We want to be our own banks; we want financial freedom.&#8221;</p>



<p>To those unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, this may sound, as Edwards says, “naïve and dangerously optimistic,” but he feels this proves that we have “been conditioned into thinking that we can’t achieve our financial dreams. This is what crypto aims to change.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is Gold 2.0. It&#8217;s a huge, huge, huge deal.”</p><cite>Chamath Palihapitiya, Venture Capitalist (Video Below)</cite></blockquote></figure>

</div></figure>



<p>Although cryptocurrency is decentralised, there is a sense of community found among investors, which has allowed projects within the cryptocurrency universe to thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community members helping one another get involved into cryptocurrency. “Through interacting with people in the Telegram groups and on discord, there is a sense of a common goal to build something unique in the DeFi space,” said Edwards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point in time, cryptocurrency is still considered to be a gamble. A lot more research needs to be done. But the future importance of cryptocurrency is becoming clearer as the technology develops. With Bitcoin now being a legal tender, cryptocurrency is now becoming more relevant than ever. With talks of cryptocurrency soon becoming a way of paying for everyday items and a new way to break away from the 9-5 life, we should give cryptocurrency more of a thought.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the murders of Gotham’s elite, &#8216;The Batman&#8217; trails alongside the perpetrator’s (the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/riddler" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/riddler" target="_blank">Riddler</a>) cryptic clues left behind at the crime scenes to unmask the villain and restore justice to the streets of Gotham. However, Batman is forced to investigate the city’s hidden corruption and question his family’s involvement. In turn, Batman’s relationship with Commissioner <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/james-gordon" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/james-gordon" target="_blank">James Gordon</a> becomes apparent, as well as the introduction to his own acquaintance with Catwoman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the audience trailed into a point of view cold open to the Riddler and his first murder, the movie already created a set-in-stone grungy, neo-noir tonality. This opening is then followed by the introduction to Batman via criminals being riddled by the fear of the shadows in a rainy dark Gotham. In turn, the audience has no other option but to feel like they are somehow committing a crime and that they should also fear the legend of the Batman themselves. This well-versed resonance feel with a comic book accurate depiction of Batman has already left the die-hard fans begging for more. His entry onto the screens following an intimidating metal clanking that could mock <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob_Marley" data-type="URL" data-id="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob_Marley" target="_blank">Marley’s</a> chains in &#8216;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol" target="_blank">A Christmas Carol</a>&#8216;, leaves us presented with our first look at the suited-up Robert Pattison’s Batman. Which of course many people have different opinions on, but of course paved the way for some amazing cinematic shots.</p>

<p>Throughout the almost 3-hour action film, we then follow this vengeance-seeking, angry, not-one to pull his punches Batman who in his own right remains angry at the corruption ruining Gotham- the same corruption that killed his parents. Matt Reeves deviated from showing the obvious popular storyline of Bruce Wayne’s parents dying and instead focuses primarily on the mental states and thought processes of Bruce Wayne and Batman, a point of view never focused on so greatly before, giving way to a whole new psychological depiction of Batman and Bruce Wayne. </p>



<p>A depiction finally giving credit to the independent intellect of Batman who no longer relies on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/alfred-pennyworth" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/alfred-pennyworth" target="_blank">Alfred’s</a> intellectual input, rather showcasing his detective skills throughout his mission to unmask the Riddler.</p>

<p>Following along with the Riddler’s games we are spoon-fed increments of Batman’s personality. While we come to understand quite early on that we are watching the storyline of a younger version of batman- only 2 years since Bruce Wayne took on the role of Batman, the rage and sadness of Bruce perfectly seeps through the poker-faced Batman façade, making him arguably the most violent depiction of Batman seen on screen so far. Batman is seen beating criminals within inches of their lives multiple times on screen, the most notable being just after the final battle between Batman and the Riddler’s men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The storyline becomes tainted by Batman’s discovery of his own family’s involvement in Gotham’s corruption, sending the young superhero down a questioning spiral of his own moral values, values that he once believed made him begin fighting for all the right reasons. From here we understand the praise Robert Pattison receives for his outstanding performance as the Batman as he finally shatters the role of Batman, letting Bruce’s emotions and thoughts take over as he fears for Alfred.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matt Reeves and Robert&#8217;s perfect on-screen balance between Batman’s strive for vengeance and Bruce’s yearning for companionship and approval ideally sets the film. The film perfectly captures a cinematic rebirth of Batman, this time pulling reality into the picture, also addressing the young side of Batman in great detail. Batman becomes strung along and tied in with the Riddler’s crimes, showcasing the vulnerability of the character and how much he still must learn.</p>



<p>However, whilst the main attention remains on Pattison’s performance as Batman and the future of his role as Batman, enough cannot be said about Zoe’s performance as Catwoman or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pauldanoofficial/?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/pauldanoofficial/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Dano’s</a> performance as The Riddler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reeve’s vision behind Catwoman also follows a comic book accurate anti-heroine whose relationship with Batman remains questionable. Despite Catwoman’s storyline not totally laying to rest the character&#8217;s historically twisted underpinning of a sexually charged creation, Catwoman is almost given her own legacy to avenge her mother’s and her friend’s (Annika) death and to ultimately leave Gotham. As to which, Zoe’s performance gives way for a strong female lead, leading the way for the future of Catwoman and leading by example for future female superheroes, villains, or anti-heroes within the DC universe.</p>

<p>Dano’s performance as the Riddler totally knocks <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jimcarrey__/?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/jimcarrey__/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim Carrey’s</a> comic relief depiction of the character out of the park. Although their storylines are not close to comparable, the sheer psychological torture felt by his performance almost convinces us he truly does belong in Arkham, or even a real-life mental asylum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, &#8216;The Batman&#8217; (2022) has made way for some of the most promising live-action future depictions of the superhero franchise. From a cinematic rebirth of Batman to create a more tied down realistic depiction, focusing on building the character from the bottom, starting with his mental stability, to teasers of the Joker as the next villain camo, superhero fans are in for a long, but worthwhile, wait on the edge of their seats.
