<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>In a recent short film, sta</strong></em><strong><em>rlings help a lonely elderly man find his way back to the experience of the world around.</em> </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">It is silence that opens the short film <em>Starlings</em>, directed by Simon Allen. But despite the dullness of muffled noises suffocated in the background, it speaks loudly, in a captivating fashion. And it does, for the protagonist of this story has to respond to two types of deafness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The first is a physical impairment that requires him to wear a hearing aid to retrieve his ability to detect sounds, while the second is a form of social isolation, perhaps fed by the awareness that the device allows him to get back, which keeps him out of a world that he does not feel connected to anymore.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-466" width="610" height="316" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>The man wears a hearing aid. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I wanted to explore the concept of loneliness,” said Alexandra Prew, who wrote the script of the film. “I was really interested in a silent film with no dialogues, which I knew was going to be a challenge.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The picture, presented in-person for the first time at the London Short Film Festival last January, was selected along with six other international submissions as part of <em>Anthropocene’s Deities</em>. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.shortfilms.org.uk/events/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.shortfilms.org.uk/events/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities" target="_blank">event</a>, held at the Institute of Contemporary Art, aimed at digging into and contemplating the richness and fragility of ecosystems, where several, divergent beings run into the other and interact.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The single human character, played by Bedfordshire actor Carl Welch, is an elderly man whose name remains unknown almost to avoid any specification that could limit the narrative to only one person. He spends the days growing plants in his garden and, as if these were mirrors of his solitary existence, shielding them from the attacks of starlings that land on the allotment and eat produce.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“The movie captures the loneliness of capitalist societies in our disconnection from nature,” said Emma Bouraba, who curated the programme and took part in the pre-selection of films to be later shortlisted for this year’s edition of the Festival. “It shows the fight we have against the ecology we are a part of.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Starlings turn out to be the ultimate species to convey this message. They act as intruders that invade and hinder the cynical, self-centred and isolated life cycle of the man and his vines, which reject any experience of concurrence and seek their expulsion.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I got googling starlings and I was like, wait, everyone hates these birds,” said Prew. “They are huge pests: a big problem for agriculture and farming.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">According to <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/reports/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/reports/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>, European starlings are often the reason of damages to apples, blue berries, cherries, figs and grapes, as they either cause direct losses from eating fruits or reduce product quality by pecking and slashing at them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The ecology portrayed in the film is analogous. Human conventions are unearthed and relentlessly confronted with the perseverance of the birds that, despite the manifold attempts set out by the man to send them away, carry on returning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">An anti-bird netting, stifling and tightening around the plants, as if to put an end to the growth that would bring them into a direct discovery of their surroundings; ultrasonic repellents to annoy the birds and even the classic scarecrow, made from scraps, cuttings, leftover buttons, that the protagonist tries and make abnormal and intimidating in accordance with human perception, which is accustomed to creating and loathing what is Other. All efforts would fail in their intent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-467" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>All attempts to remove birds prove ineffective. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The dread of the unnaturalness would only be conceived by the man and rather overlooked by the still innocent, uncorrupted birds. Nonetheless, the solution would be meanly found by killing one of them, ultimately eliminating what is seen as unwelcome and further isolating from the experience of social contact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-470" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The man kills one of the birds in his garden. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Shot during the second wave of harder restrictions imposed in the U.K. to quell the spread of the coronavirus, the short film was able to touch on the question of loneliness as people were increasingly becoming familiar with it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I wrote the script before lockdown happened and before we even knew anything about Covid-19,” said Prew. “Then the subject matter became even more prevalent.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">According to a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a> published by the Office for National Statistics in 2020, the equivalent of 7.4 million people said that their well-being was affected through feeling lonely during the first month of lockdown. In particular, research found that those aged 16 to 24 were more likely to have experienced loneliness due to Covid-19 tough regulations, namely 50.8% of respondents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">A previous <a href="https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/basw_94738-5_0.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/basw_94738-5_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> that had looked into the impact of loneliness in similar age groups in 2017, published by U.K. charity Action for Children and the MP Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, had found that 43% of young people had undergone through such feelings even prior to the pandemic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The actual number of teenagers and young adults suffering from this condition might even be higher, as loneliness often trivially conceals among people who experience it despite the fact they are not necessarily alone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Loneliness is a subjective feeling that arises when one feels that there is a gap between their desired and actual social contacts,” said Sam Fardghassemi, who is teaching fellow in the Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology at UCL and has conducted in-depth work to analyse the issue in young people of London.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Due to this ambivalence, loneliness differs from social isolation. This circumstance, in which the man is presented in the first half of the film, can be described as the objective, partial reduction or total exclusion of other social contacts from one person’s daily life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Japan has often been associated with the issue. In the country, young adults who are socially reclused are estimated to have topped 500,000 and different nuances of withdrawal have been found over time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><em>Sotokomori</em> (Japanese for withdrawn, outside) refers to people whose outings are only limited to pursuing their interests, their agenda, or fulfilling practical needs such as food shopping. A more acute type of isolation concerns <em>hikikomori</em> (Japanese for withdrawn, inside), who are known to totally cut themselves off from the external world.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The latter state is emphasised in the man’s purchase of ultrasonic repellents to try and get rid of the birds, that he makes online, without leaving home and confining in a comfort zone he has built, whereby nothing else can meddle.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“It is as if they continue to exist as a being while being socially dead, and passively observing outside activities,” said Dr Maki Rooksby of the Institute of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Glasgow, whose expertise also covers social isolation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Discovered in the mid-1980s as a socio-cultural phenomenon by Japanese psychiatrist Tamaki Saito, who would later coin the term, hikikomori only seemed to belong to Japan.</p>

</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I had not come across anything the same as hikikomori, as a recognised, semi-widespread, identifiable social phenomenon in the UK,” said Professor Robert MacDonald, who is co-Editor in Chief of Journal of Youth Studies, referring to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.the-sarf.org.uk/the-new-british-hikikomori/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.the-sarf.org.uk/the-new-british-hikikomori/" target="_blank">piece</a> he had written in 2015 about the existence of British hikikomori.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">More recently, things might have changed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Although we don&#8217;t know very much whether some countries are more vulnerable to it and how, we know it is a global mental health issue today, with cases reported throughout the world,” said Dr Rooksby.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Identifying, gauging and understanding the issue allows us to figure out the most appropriate solutions to let patients get back to appreciating the beauty of discovery and contact with what is around.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Effective treatment approaches include those where clinicians tune in with the withdrawn person and share the journey of exploring interests or activities that may help them find meaning in their lives,” said Dr Rooksby.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">In the case of the protagonist, the journey will be the pictorial flight of starlings shown in a documentary on television, where the birds dance and shape cinematic images in the sky in a rigorous-yet-liberating synchronised hymn to community and interaction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The murmuration will work as a glimpse of the world that he has missed and still might miss; a glimpse of the complex system of our contemporary societies in which the role of each component is critical but always dependant on the acknowledgement of the Other.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">It will work as a positive change of the man’s mind, a mighty driving force that will get him out of his armchair, out of his house to buy food dispensers that would feed those birds that, he now knows, are worth welcoming. </p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Curator Karen Serres reflects on the role that portraiture plays in defining the post-Impressionist painter.</strong></em></p>



<p>There is something uncanny in the hands of a painter. Something that flows through their fingers and reaches the end of the brush, leaving a trace on the canvas. A connection that unveils what is in fact behind a hasty stroke, and conveys the signs of an artist’s time and space. Now, imagine you slightly move back, open your eyes wide and realise that their fingers, their hands, along with the rest of their body, can be viewed. This is the magic of self-portraits.</p>



<p>In the case of post-Impressionist master Vincent van Gogh, 16 of such works are displayed in an unmissable exhibition at The Courtauld Gallery until 8 May. </p>



<p>The time spans from 1886 to 1889. In four years, his technique, his colours and his clothes would change. But, most interestingly, he himself would change. As if, underlying one of the prominent names in Western art history, there were more identities, more personas all converging into this versatile painter’s space. </p>



<p>To fully understand the nuances of van Gogh, I spoke to Dr Karen Serres, Curator of Paintings at The Courtauld Gallery and more recently, curator of the exhibition.</p>



<p><strong><em>Hi, Karen. I had the chance to visit the exhibition you and your team worked on. Was it challenging to set it up?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, is the short answer, but not for the reasons that one would expect. There is always so many van Gogh exhibitions in the world and we wanted to do an exhibition that was different. We always knew that it was going to be something around the self-portrait of the bandaged ear, which is in our collection, but we didn&#8217;t know which direction to take it in.</p>

<p><strong><em>What have you done?</em></strong></p>



<p>We started looking at other self-portraits exhibitions. We were surprised that there hadn&#8217;t been one in the past, but that is because these works are so in demand, that it is just really difficult to get them all at the same time in the same place. We sent out our first loan letter seven years ago. All of the loans that we asked for were agreed, but the real challenge was finding the right date, then further complicated by the pandemic.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you choose to focus on self-portraiture?</em></strong></p>



<p>For van Gogh, there is a notion of just your own features being very familiar. They are ever shifting, but they are also very intimate. It is something very captivating to return to over time because you notice new things, you represent new things.</p>



<p><strong><em>What was your goal?</em></strong></p>



<p>We only have two rooms at The Courtauld and we really wanted the exhibition to move away from the myth of the tortured genius while being very focused, so as to let people leave having enjoyed the works but also having learned something and actually changed or perhaps challenged the way you think about some of his works.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think you succeeded?</em></strong></p>



<p>It was easy for a van Gogh exhibition to be very blockbuster-y as it is such a famous name, but I think it actually shows the evolution of his style and life through one single motif; it makes it more complicated. You can really take time and look at each work one by one, and then you&#8217;re also able to make relationships.</p>

<p><strong><em>The idea you have when you are in the rooms is that van Gogh was many things at once. How many alter egos can visitors spot in the exhibition?</em></strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>It is subjective, but a lot of his persona is really wrapped up and projected into those works. It is only when you look around that you have all these people looking at you, that there is a physical relationship which is very important. I think one identity is definitely the more traditional Parisian, bourgeois man that you do not know what his profession is. He is really just well-dressed and often with a felt hat.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Then you have his identity as a painter, when he&#8217;s wearing the blue smock and the straw hat. Later on, he employs self-portraiture when he is recovering from some kind of crisis. There, you really feel that there is much more charge and you can tell that he is almost using this as a lifeboat.</p>

<p><strong><em>If we compare van Gogh to other artists who used self-portraiture, do you think we would discover a similar application of this technique?</em></strong></p>



<p>There was an exhibition a few years ago at the Royal Academy by a Finnish artist called Helene Schjerfbeck who would illustrate her old age truthfully, in a very stark way. Previously, other artists like Gustave Courbet and Paul Gauguin had played much more with their identity. Some of them dressed up, sometimes they changed their periods or wore other clothing and they did that on purpose to unsettle the viewer.</p>



<p><strong><em>How does van Gogh differ?</em></strong></p>



<p>There is no faking in him and everything feels very honest. Moreover, I think what is unique about him is the timescale. He evolved so much during his time in Paris, and then just as he was finding this recognisable and very powerful style, his mental health crisis happened. It is thought-provoking to see these compressed moments work together or against each other.</p>

<p><strong><em>Even colours tend to change over time. What can this transformation tell us about van Gogh as an artist and as a human being?</em></strong></p>



<p>What is most fascinating, and that is also why we wrote down the months, is actually how quickly this happens. You can see this evolution almost from month to month. He goes from the darker colours that he took from Rembrandt and then as soon as he knows more, and looks at more works by the Impressionists, he definitely adopts their much lighter colours. And then as he evolves over those four years, he uses these very bold pure colours like pure orange or pure blue. This is a progression that you see in his other works as well, but it&#8217;s obviously not as easy to see because the motifs are different.</p>



<p><strong><em>In the second room visitors can also find <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-van-goghs-chair" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-van-goghs-chair" target="_blank">van Gogh’s chair</a> and his portrait of the Belgian painter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" target="_blank">Eugène Boch</a>, respectively from collections at the National Gallery and Musée d&#8217;Orsay, as if these paintings contributed to the overall idea of his identity. Why did you include them?</em></strong> </p>



<p>We wanted to slightly push the notion of self-representation a bit beyond, just having his self-portraits to make people think a little bit more and indeed to be able to compare how he represented himself and how he represented other people and things as well. We had a very long debate about Eugene Boch’s portrait.</p>



<p><strong><em>Did you disagree?</em></strong></p>



<p>Even during the time, people said that Boch and van Gogh looked alike. They had the same slightly angular features, the same little beard and the dark blonde hair. We were worried that people were going to think actually that it that it was van Gogh and it was going to get complicated.&nbsp; Yet one of the reasons why he did some portraits, he says, was as an exercise to become a really good portrait painter of other people. As he wrote about this person being an ideal artist, we felt that there was so much of his own projection into this work that we wanted to include it but to be honest we were not 100% sure how it was going to work.</p>



<p><strong><em>What can you tell me about the background of this work?</em></strong></p>



<p>The backgrounds in his own self-portraits are very vague, abstract. They don&#8217;t represent anything and the only one that actually depicts something is The Courtauld’s self-portrait with bandaged ear where you can actually have a recognisable backdrop. What is gripping in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" target="_blank">Boch</a>’s is that it is not only recognisable, but also imaginary. This starry sky is a really nice comparison between a real kind of identifiable background and then a dreamy scene that is so important for van Gogh.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think the choice of self-portraiture contributed to the success of this exhibition?</em></strong></p>



<p>I think self-portraiture has taken a new residence for people. Several people have commented that it you look at self-portraits differently after the pandemic. Maybe we now have a different relationship to it, as before there was a notion that if an artist was making a self-portrait, they were being very vain or narcissistic. I hope now that, looking at this exploration of our features, it is a little bit more nuanced in our minds and there is a moving aspect to it.</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Amid increasing gentrification affecting areas of East London, residents of Brick Lane risk having the same fate of their ancestors: leaving.</strong></em></p>



<p>Building, that&#8217;s what bricks are for. Since their invention, prior to 7500 BC, bricks have become a viable alternative in construction. But they have also gained a poignant meaning in history that is synonymous with peoples, families. Arrivals, departures, encounters. Because, with bricks, dwellings are built, bridges are erected, markets and community centres are created, roads are levelled, connecting and putting a place on the map, giving it life, presence, relevance.</p>



<p>On Brick Lane, and in the areas of Spitalfields and Tower Hamlets in East London, bricks have become the idiosyncratic allegory of centuries of traditions, communities. Growth, blended with stability. A stability achieved through inclusivity, acceptance, and a flow of transformations that, in the course of its existence, marked it to the point of becoming a crossroads open to all and in the heart of everyone.</p>



<p>“I have always been here,” said Rahad Miah, who works at the popular Bengal Village, while listening to traditional Bengali music in the background. “I was used to coming when I was a kid and I am still here.”</p>

<p>A field path in the countryside outside the City of London in 1500s, the street welcomed early Flemish settlers, whose brick kilns gave it its characteristic name. But it was not until the second half of 17<sup>th</sup> century, when other roads were laid out, that the area started developing and taking its modern, urban appearance.</p>



<p>Among other buildings, breweries popped up prosperously. The largest site, extended over the centuries, was bought by Joseph Truman in 1676 and kept actively producing beer until the end of 1990s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-965" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg 1516w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The Old Truman Brewery. Photo by Simone Pellegrino.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Currently owned by the Zeloof partnership, the complex has been used by small independent businesses as well as grassroots creative and cultural organisations. </p>



<p>In September 2021, the latest chapter of a long story of mutations began. A local committee approved <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/documents/s190863/Appendix%201%20-%20PA2000415%20-%20DC%20Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">plans</a> for a 5-story development that would replace part of the Old Truman brewery with offices and brand-name chain shops.</p>



<p>For years, the area suffered corporate developments spreading from the richer City of London. This affected local communities with rising living costs and consequent displacement, as if the place their ancestors created took them back to their initial, mutual condition: leaving.</p>



<p>From 1680s onwards, a large community of Protestant Huguenots fleeing from persecutions in France moved to the area. Their textile skills and the fabrics brought from cities such as Nantes and Lyon enabled the district to emerge in weaving and garment making.</p>



<p>Their religion, which finally found relief in Huguenot Church on Brick Lane, co-existed with Anglicanism professed in the nearby Christ Church on Commercial Street.</p>



<p>These two faiths were joined first by the Jewish community of Ashkenazi and Yiddish-speaking Russian Jews sheltering from the wave of anti-Semitic pogroms in 19<sup>th</sup>&#8211; and 20<sup>th</sup>-century Eastern Europe and, more recently, by a large number of Muslim Bangladeshi Bengalis.</p>



<p>The latter, who left their land at the height of the war of independence from Pakistan, would work in the thriving local tailoring industry or open some of the iconic curry restaurants that even led to informally call the area ‘Banglatown’.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, bricks would keep changing their face as time went by. They would take on the colour of the graffiti that would often cover them, the scent of the fumes that would reach them from the kitchens, the taste of a pint of beer brewed in the district and spilled on the ground.</p>



<p>“It changed a lot,” said Miah. “Many of Bengalis left the area, many restaurants closed and the choice is not that diversified anymore.”</p>



<p>According to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/204259709/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/204259709/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted by Centre on The Dynamics of Ethnicity and Runnymede Trust to gauge the current state of Brick Lane and its ethnical diversity, 17 restaurants have closed since 2014, leaving only 22 eateries open.</p>



<p>Ironically, it is as if the action of building has also inherent its own contradiction. While it is true that bricks are employed to erect bridges, they are also used to raise walls, to establish watchtowers from which to flush out the enemy and, as in the case of Brick Lane, to feed the dangerous greed that might turn ‘building’ into the equivalent of ‘demolishing’.</p>

<p>Although the process, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://battleforbricklane.com/the-threat" data-type="URL" data-id="https://battleforbricklane.com/the-threat" target="_blank">deemed</a> soulless by critics, followed the more common paradigm of what is described as gentrification, it also jeopardised the particular urban character of the district, and caused the loss of meaningful places.</p>



<p>According to <a href="http://classonline.org.uk/docs/Pushed_to_the_Margins_Gentrification_report_v5.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://classonline.org.uk/docs/Pushed_to_the_Margins_Gentrification_report_v5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> conducted by Centre for Labour and Social Studies and Runnymede Trust, the borough of Tower Hamlets was among those which gentrified most between 2010 and 2014.</p>



<p>In Brick Lane, “there are common dynamics of gentrification in increasing profits by improving the building stock and upgrading their usage for higher-rank users,” said Dr Ryan Centner, who is Assistant Professor of Urban Geographies in the Department of Geography and Environment at LSE. “But its gentrification has been influenced by a form of <em>tourist-ification</em>, in turning the place into a touristic attraction.” </p>



<p>Prior to the pandemic, more than 18,500 pedestrians walked along the street on an average day, according to <a href="https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/News_events/2021/August-2021/Welcome-Back-Brick-Lane.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> provided by Tower Hamlets council, making it one of London&#8217;s main cultural destinations.</p>



<p>In a statement released in April 2021, Jason Zeloof, on behalf of the partnership, had denied that the site would be transformed into a shopping mall, and had declared that his association would offer 20% of space to independent stores.</p>



<p>If some wait for an uncertain future with hope, many other residents decry the institutional carelessness for their concerns over the plan, which were repeatedly raised through protests and campaigning on social media.</p>

<p>A shopping centre would let Brick Lane become a “much more congested place” and lose its unpretentious nature, said Rahad Miah.</p>



<p>Mahbuba Sultana, who works in her family business in the Upmarket space of the Old Truman Brewery, seemed to disagree. </p>



<p>“A shopping mall would help us see more faces,” she said. “It would be like Westfield, where people have everything in one place.”</p>

<p>With living costs already sitting at record high levels, the new development would further revamp the population of the area.</p>



<p>“The mall inevitably would bring a change in the demographics of residents, more businesses, like premium brands, an increase in local jobs, and a surge in rent and prices that will likely be slightly higher than the average growth in London,” said Austin Walker, who is a Sales Negotiator for real estate services provider Savills.</p>



<p>While the project got approved, its progress will depend on the outcome of a judicial review that campaigners from the Save Brick Lane coalition, created to fight the threats of gentrification for the local community, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/planning/401-planning-news/49501-high-court-gives-permission-for-judicial-review-over-impact-of-development-on-diversity-and-character-of-brick-lane-area" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/planning/401-planning-news/49501-high-court-gives-permission-for-judicial-review-over-impact-of-development-on-diversity-and-character-of-brick-lane-area" target="_blank">have been granted</a> by the High Court.</p>



<p>The group even started a crowdfunding initiative on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-brick-lane/" target="_blank">CrowdJustice</a> to cover costly legal fees and sustain their action against Tower Hamlets council. At the time of writing, donations topped £10,000.</p>



<p>On top of the burden that gentrification put on local residents and businesses, the backlash of Brexit might be the finishing blow. Curry houses were reportedly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/bangladeshi-caterers-association-calls-on-mps-to-throw-out-brexit-3612080" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/bangladeshi-caterers-association-calls-on-mps-to-throw-out-brexit-3612080" target="_blank">forced to close</a>, as visa rules were toughened amid a general clampdown on immigrants.</p>



<p>“Everything got expensive and it became very hard to survive,” said Forhad Ahmed, who manages an off-license on Brick Lane. “Brexit forgot the foreigners of this country.”</p>
