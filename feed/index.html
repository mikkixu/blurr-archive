<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>In a recent short film, sta</strong></em><strong><em>rlings help a lonely elderly man find his way back to the experience of the world around.</em> </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">It is silence that opens the short film <em>Starlings</em>, directed by Simon Allen. But despite the dullness of muffled noises suffocated in the background, it speaks loudly, in a captivating fashion. And it does, for the protagonist of this story has to respond to two types of deafness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The first is a physical impairment that requires him to wear a hearing aid to retrieve his ability to detect sounds, while the second is a form of social isolation, perhaps fed by the awareness that the device allows him to get back, which keeps him out of a world that he does not feel connected to anymore.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-466" width="610" height="316" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>The man wears a hearing aid. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I wanted to explore the concept of loneliness,” said Alexandra Prew, who wrote the script of the film. “I was really interested in a silent film with no dialogues, which I knew was going to be a challenge.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The picture, presented in-person for the first time at the London Short Film Festival last January, was selected along with six other international submissions as part of <em>Anthropocene’s Deities</em>. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.shortfilms.org.uk/events/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.shortfilms.org.uk/events/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities" target="_blank">event</a>, held at the Institute of Contemporary Art, aimed at digging into and contemplating the richness and fragility of ecosystems, where several, divergent beings run into the other and interact.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The single human character, played by Bedfordshire actor Carl Welch, is an elderly man whose name remains unknown almost to avoid any specification that could limit the narrative to only one person. He spends the days growing plants in his garden and, as if these were mirrors of his solitary existence, shielding them from the attacks of starlings that land on the allotment and eat produce.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“The movie captures the loneliness of capitalist societies in our disconnection from nature,” said Emma Bouraba, who curated the programme and took part in the pre-selection of films to be later shortlisted for this year’s edition of the Festival. “It shows the fight we have against the ecology we are a part of.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Starlings turn out to be the ultimate species to convey this message. They act as intruders that invade and hinder the cynical, self-centred and isolated life cycle of the man and his vines, which reject any experience of concurrence and seek their expulsion.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I got googling starlings and I was like, wait, everyone hates these birds,” said Prew. “They are huge pests: a big problem for agriculture and farming.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">According to <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/reports/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/reports/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>, European starlings are often the reason of damages to apples, blue berries, cherries, figs and grapes, as they either cause direct losses from eating fruits or reduce product quality by pecking and slashing at them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The ecology portrayed in the film is analogous. Human conventions are unearthed and relentlessly confronted with the perseverance of the birds that, despite the manifold attempts set out by the man to send them away, carry on returning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">An anti-bird netting, stifling and tightening around the plants, as if to put an end to the growth that would bring them into a direct discovery of their surroundings; ultrasonic repellents to annoy the birds and even the classic scarecrow, made from scraps, cuttings, leftover buttons, that the protagonist tries and make abnormal and intimidating in accordance with human perception, which is accustomed to creating and loathing what is Other. All efforts would fail in their intent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-467" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>All attempts to remove birds prove ineffective. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The dread of the unnaturalness would only be conceived by the man and rather overlooked by the still innocent, uncorrupted birds. Nonetheless, the solution would be meanly found by killing one of them, ultimately eliminating what is seen as unwelcome and further isolating from the experience of social contact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-470" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The man kills one of the birds in his garden. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Shot during the second wave of harder restrictions imposed in the U.K. to quell the spread of the coronavirus, the short film was able to touch on the question of loneliness as people were increasingly becoming familiar with it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I wrote the script before lockdown happened and before we even knew anything about Covid-19,” said Prew. “Then the subject matter became even more prevalent.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">According to a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a> published by the Office for National Statistics in 2020, the equivalent of 7.4 million people said that their well-being was affected through feeling lonely during the first month of lockdown. In particular, research found that those aged 16 to 24 were more likely to have experienced loneliness due to Covid-19 tough regulations, namely 50.8% of respondents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">A previous <a href="https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/basw_94738-5_0.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/basw_94738-5_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> that had looked into the impact of loneliness in similar age groups in 2017, published by U.K. charity Action for Children and the MP Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, had found that 43% of young people had undergone through such feelings even prior to the pandemic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The actual number of teenagers and young adults suffering from this condition might even be higher, as loneliness often trivially conceals among people who experience it despite the fact they are not necessarily alone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Loneliness is a subjective feeling that arises when one feels that there is a gap between their desired and actual social contacts,” said Sam Fardghassemi, who is teaching fellow in the Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology at UCL and has conducted in-depth work to analyse the issue in young people of London.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Due to this ambivalence, loneliness differs from social isolation. This circumstance, in which the man is presented in the first half of the film, can be described as the objective, partial reduction or total exclusion of other social contacts from one person’s daily life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Japan has often been associated with the issue. In the country, young adults who are socially reclused are estimated to have topped 500,000 and different nuances of withdrawal have been found over time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><em>Sotokomori</em> (Japanese for withdrawn, outside) refers to people whose outings are only limited to pursuing their interests, their agenda, or fulfilling practical needs such as food shopping. A more acute type of isolation concerns <em>hikikomori</em> (Japanese for withdrawn, inside), who are known to totally cut themselves off from the external world.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The latter state is emphasised in the man’s purchase of ultrasonic repellents to try and get rid of the birds, that he makes online, without leaving home and confining in a comfort zone he has built, whereby nothing else can meddle.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“It is as if they continue to exist as a being while being socially dead, and passively observing outside activities,” said Dr Maki Rooksby of the Institute of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Glasgow, whose expertise also covers social isolation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Discovered in the mid-1980s as a socio-cultural phenomenon by Japanese psychiatrist Tamaki Saito, who would later coin the term, hikikomori only seemed to belong to Japan.</p>

</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I had not come across anything the same as hikikomori, as a recognised, semi-widespread, identifiable social phenomenon in the UK,” said Professor Robert MacDonald, who is co-Editor in Chief of Journal of Youth Studies, referring to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.the-sarf.org.uk/the-new-british-hikikomori/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.the-sarf.org.uk/the-new-british-hikikomori/" target="_blank">piece</a> he had written in 2015 about the existence of British hikikomori.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">More recently, things might have changed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Although we don&#8217;t know very much whether some countries are more vulnerable to it and how, we know it is a global mental health issue today, with cases reported throughout the world,” said Dr Rooksby.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Identifying, gauging and understanding the issue allows us to figure out the most appropriate solutions to let patients get back to appreciating the beauty of discovery and contact with what is around.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Effective treatment approaches include those where clinicians tune in with the withdrawn person and share the journey of exploring interests or activities that may help them find meaning in their lives,” said Dr Rooksby.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">In the case of the protagonist, the journey will be the pictorial flight of starlings shown in a documentary on television, where the birds dance and shape cinematic images in the sky in a rigorous-yet-liberating synchronised hymn to community and interaction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The murmuration will work as a glimpse of the world that he has missed and still might miss; a glimpse of the complex system of our contemporary societies in which the role of each component is critical but always dependant on the acknowledgement of the Other.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">It will work as a positive change of the man’s mind, a mighty driving force that will get him out of his armchair, out of his house to buy food dispensers that would feed those birds that, he now knows, are worth welcoming. </p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Curator Karen Serres reflects on the role that portraiture plays in defining the post-Impressionist painter.</strong></em></p>



<p>There is something uncanny in the hands of a painter. Something that flows through their fingers and reaches the end of the brush, leaving a trace on the canvas. A connection that unveils what is in fact behind a hasty stroke, and conveys the signs of an artist’s time and space. Now, imagine you slightly move back, open your eyes wide and realise that their fingers, their hands, along with the rest of their body, can be viewed. This is the magic of self-portraits.</p>



<p>In the case of post-Impressionist master Vincent van Gogh, 16 of such works are displayed in an unmissable exhibition at The Courtauld Gallery until 8 May. </p>



<p>The time spans from 1886 to 1889. In four years, his technique, his colours and his clothes would change. But, most interestingly, he himself would change. As if, underlying one of the prominent names in Western art history, there were more identities, more personas all converging into this versatile painter’s space. </p>



<p>To fully understand the nuances of van Gogh, I spoke to Dr Karen Serres, Curator of Paintings at The Courtauld Gallery and more recently, curator of the exhibition.</p>



<p><strong><em>Hi, Karen. I had the chance to visit the exhibition you and your team worked on. Was it challenging to set it up?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, is the short answer, but not for the reasons that one would expect. There is always so many van Gogh exhibitions in the world and we wanted to do an exhibition that was different. We always knew that it was going to be something around the self-portrait of the bandaged ear, which is in our collection, but we didn&#8217;t know which direction to take it in.</p>

<p><strong><em>What have you done?</em></strong></p>



<p>We started looking at other self-portraits exhibitions. We were surprised that there hadn&#8217;t been one in the past, but that is because these works are so in demand, that it is just really difficult to get them all at the same time in the same place. We sent out our first loan letter seven years ago. All of the loans that we asked for were agreed, but the real challenge was finding the right date, then further complicated by the pandemic.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you choose to focus on self-portraiture?</em></strong></p>



<p>For van Gogh, there is a notion of just your own features being very familiar. They are ever shifting, but they are also very intimate. It is something very captivating to return to over time because you notice new things, you represent new things.</p>



<p><strong><em>What was your goal?</em></strong></p>



<p>We only have two rooms at The Courtauld and we really wanted the exhibition to move away from the myth of the tortured genius while being very focused, so as to let people leave having enjoyed the works but also having learned something and actually changed or perhaps challenged the way you think about some of his works.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think you succeeded?</em></strong></p>



<p>It was easy for a van Gogh exhibition to be very blockbuster-y as it is such a famous name, but I think it actually shows the evolution of his style and life through one single motif; it makes it more complicated. You can really take time and look at each work one by one, and then you&#8217;re also able to make relationships.</p>

<p><strong><em>The idea you have when you are in the rooms is that van Gogh was many things at once. How many alter egos can visitors spot in the exhibition?</em></strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>It is subjective, but a lot of his persona is really wrapped up and projected into those works. It is only when you look around that you have all these people looking at you, that there is a physical relationship which is very important. I think one identity is definitely the more traditional Parisian, bourgeois man that you do not know what his profession is. He is really just well-dressed and often with a felt hat.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Then you have his identity as a painter, when he&#8217;s wearing the blue smock and the straw hat. Later on, he employs self-portraiture when he is recovering from some kind of crisis. There, you really feel that there is much more charge and you can tell that he is almost using this as a lifeboat.</p>

<p><strong><em>If we compare van Gogh to other artists who used self-portraiture, do you think we would discover a similar application of this technique?</em></strong></p>



<p>There was an exhibition a few years ago at the Royal Academy by a Finnish artist called Helene Schjerfbeck who would illustrate her old age truthfully, in a very stark way. Previously, other artists like Gustave Courbet and Paul Gauguin had played much more with their identity. Some of them dressed up, sometimes they changed their periods or wore other clothing and they did that on purpose to unsettle the viewer.</p>



<p><strong><em>How does van Gogh differ?</em></strong></p>



<p>There is no faking in him and everything feels very honest. Moreover, I think what is unique about him is the timescale. He evolved so much during his time in Paris, and then just as he was finding this recognisable and very powerful style, his mental health crisis happened. It is thought-provoking to see these compressed moments work together or against each other.</p>

<p><strong><em>Even colours tend to change over time. What can this transformation tell us about van Gogh as an artist and as a human being?</em></strong></p>



<p>What is most fascinating, and that is also why we wrote down the months, is actually how quickly this happens. You can see this evolution almost from month to month. He goes from the darker colours that he took from Rembrandt and then as soon as he knows more, and looks at more works by the Impressionists, he definitely adopts their much lighter colours. And then as he evolves over those four years, he uses these very bold pure colours like pure orange or pure blue. This is a progression that you see in his other works as well, but it&#8217;s obviously not as easy to see because the motifs are different.</p>



<p><strong><em>In the second room visitors can also find <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-van-goghs-chair" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-van-goghs-chair" target="_blank">van Gogh’s chair</a> and his portrait of the Belgian painter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" target="_blank">Eugène Boch</a>, respectively from collections at the National Gallery and Musée d&#8217;Orsay, as if these paintings contributed to the overall idea of his identity. Why did you include them?</em></strong> </p>



<p>We wanted to slightly push the notion of self-representation a bit beyond, just having his self-portraits to make people think a little bit more and indeed to be able to compare how he represented himself and how he represented other people and things as well. We had a very long debate about Eugene Boch’s portrait.</p>



<p><strong><em>Did you disagree?</em></strong></p>



<p>Even during the time, people said that Boch and van Gogh looked alike. They had the same slightly angular features, the same little beard and the dark blonde hair. We were worried that people were going to think actually that it that it was van Gogh and it was going to get complicated.&nbsp; Yet one of the reasons why he did some portraits, he says, was as an exercise to become a really good portrait painter of other people. As he wrote about this person being an ideal artist, we felt that there was so much of his own projection into this work that we wanted to include it but to be honest we were not 100% sure how it was going to work.</p>



<p><strong><em>What can you tell me about the background of this work?</em></strong></p>



<p>The backgrounds in his own self-portraits are very vague, abstract. They don&#8217;t represent anything and the only one that actually depicts something is The Courtauld’s self-portrait with bandaged ear where you can actually have a recognisable backdrop. What is gripping in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" target="_blank">Boch</a>’s is that it is not only recognisable, but also imaginary. This starry sky is a really nice comparison between a real kind of identifiable background and then a dreamy scene that is so important for van Gogh.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think the choice of self-portraiture contributed to the success of this exhibition?</em></strong></p>



<p>I think self-portraiture has taken a new residence for people. Several people have commented that it you look at self-portraits differently after the pandemic. Maybe we now have a different relationship to it, as before there was a notion that if an artist was making a self-portrait, they were being very vain or narcissistic. I hope now that, looking at this exploration of our features, it is a little bit more nuanced in our minds and there is a moving aspect to it.</p>

<p>Do you wake up at sunrise to meditate and recite affirmations? Are you devoted to a 10-step skincare routine decked in Aesop and Glossier? Is your pantry stocked with dark leafy greens, vegan protein powder and a cornucopia of superfoods?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the vast majority, the answers to these questions are no. For &#8216;That Girl,&#8217; however, it’s a yes, yes and yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since April 2021, TikTok has been saturated with video titles in the vein of, ‘THAT girl morning routine,’ ‘This is your sign to become THAT girl’ and ‘How to become THAT girl.’ Obscure as the phrase is, these videos follow a uniform format that involves early mornings, daily workouts and plant-based meals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike the usual fashion-centric trends that have emerged from the short-video sharing app, That Girl allegedly favours health and wellness over aesthetic appeal. It has become a Gen Z trope, portraying quintessential self-care techniques as catalysts for productivity. But when self-love and success are exclusively promoted by light-skinned women with 23-inch waists and £80 workout leggings, how healthy is this health trend for its young and impressionable audience?</p>



<p>Some TikTok users deem That Girl as motivational. Others question its unrealistic glamourisation of health and wellness and posted more authentic depictions of their everyday lives. Australian TikToker, Hannah Powell (@the_peoples_princess), for example, shared a video emblazoned with the message: ‘When the aesthetics are immaculate, but you’re also depressed.’ The video features classic That Girl elements, such as a well-decorated bedroom and a fetching outfit, before revealing piles of dirty clothes that would otherwise be hidden behind the camera. Hannah wrote the caption, ‘Everything is a lie ! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f921.png" alt="🤡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />’</p>

<p>For users like Hannah, That Girl is a quixotic trend that treats wellness as a one-size-fits-all pursuit. In this sense, That Girl belongs to the minority. She constitutes the 1% of society, who can afford weekly Pilates classes and Whole Foods paraphernalia. Personally, I have never had enough energy to make an Instagrammable quinoa salad after my eight-hour work shift.</p>

<p>In a 2021 <strong><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13675494211055735#_i2">study on digital food cultures</a></strong>, wellness was described as being, “driven by the market and consumer culture as opposed to medical necessity.” Both physical and spiritual health were typified as “moving targets” that can never be fully actualised. With that, wellness is subsumed in the matrix of capitalism. Instead of a means to cure disease, it is a never-ending journey of reigning the mind and body through consumption. The more expensive a product is, the healthier it must be, right?</p>



<p>In theory, That Girl expresses self-love through a healthy lifestyle. In execution, it basks in the glory of name-brands and aesthetic appeal. And what is aesthetic appeal if not a crisp image of the newest <em>MacBook Pro</em> atop a <em>Lululemon</em> yoga mat? Even the bright and modern living spaces in which That Girl videos are set allude to a degree of wealth that many viewers can only romanticise from afar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, people are free to share the luxuries they have online. But as soon as a video compilation of material possessions is tagged #ThatGirl, the wellness trend becomes problematically conflated with financial status. For now, the closest I’ll ever get to a penthouse apartment is by watching a That Girl video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I really think That Girl is a toxic trend because it’s represented by rich women, who, to be honest, are usually white and thin. So there are social barriers that prevent other people from becoming That Girl,” 21-year-old Ciara told me. Our conversation about health swiftly transformed into a conversation about money. Being an art student working a part-time job, Ciara articulated the struggles of having to strictly budget her rent, food and transportation. She explained how she is left with little money for herself, which she is often forced to spend on art supplies for university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 5am, Ciara has just arrived home from her bartending job. Meanwhile, That Girl has just woken up and is now using a jade roller to depuff her face &#8211; or at least that’s what we see on TikTok. The distinction between the two has caused Ciara to feel nonplussed and excluded from the trend. The problem with That Girl is not the fact that she engages in generic notions of self-care. The problem with That Girl is the fact that she is a singular prototype devoid of nuance. She is a standard to be abided by. Girls who innately possess privileges inaccessible to most are favoured over girls like Ciara who face the less alluring side of self-improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ciara expressed her desire to see a wellness trend that is detached from social class. “Even before That Girl became popular, wellness was always promoted by influencers. They would talk about colonics and other over-the-top procedures that aren’t necessary to being well,” she explained. “It would make a world of difference if they used their influence to give practical health tips that everyone can do whether or not they’re rich.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That Girl how-to guides tend to trivialise wellness by offering esoteric advise. For instance, in a TikTok posted by @angelxadvice_, viewers were urged to “stop posting crying selfies” and to “make a sad playlist so you’re prepared for anything.” As well-favoured as an Instagram feed bereft of crying selfies may be, it does not exactly coincide with the ethos of self-help.&nbsp;</p>



https://www.tiktok.com/@urfavadv1cepage/video/6912776433475652865



<p>In an article published by i-D, Carl Cederström, a professor at Stockholm University and the co-author of <em>The Wellness Syndrome</em>, defined contemporary notions of wellness as ideological, yet directionless: “Our culture of self-help generally has no purpose. You very rarely find a book on why you should lose weight. It’s always how you should lose weight.” This highlights how wellness is clouded by aspirations so ill-defined that they appear to be purely superficial. Instead of looking within ourselves, our attention is diverted to the social currency that is physical beauty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media is notoriously effective in idealising the good and hiding the bad. The That Girl trend is emblematic of this, collating videos of feigned perfection. Users have, however, become increasingly sceptical of the media. In a survey conducted amongst 42 students from Goldsmiths, University of London, 47.4% of participants agreed that That Girl was unrealistic. When asked if they deemed the trend harmful, 30% voted yes. One student wrote, “It puts a lot of pressure on girls” and another stated, “TikTok isn’t the place to become a better person.”</p>



<p>That Girl presents glimpses of reality, but depicts them as the full truth. Watching a mere 30 seconds of a rigorous morning routine can quickly be misinterpreted as a full 24 hours of someone else’s picturesque life. I, myself, fall prey to That Girl’s endless hustle. I know I’m not alone in saying that I’m tantalised by her good looks and effortless sublimity. It’s easy to simply want to be her, but becoming her is a different story that glosses over social inequalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that <strong><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-right-mindset/201910/the-rise-and-grind-hustle-culture">research</a></strong> shows that hustle culture isn’t the only path towards self-optimisation. By redefining That Girl in your own terms, wellness can be extended beyond capitalistic structures. Instead of succumbing to external pressures, success should be approached with self-compassion, mindfulness and fortitude. Outside of social media, That Girl exists everywhere. She is Ciara, who manages to conquer the day no matter how sleep-deprived she might be. She is Hannah, who confidently defies That Girl’s picture-perfect bedroom. She is every girl resolved to be the best version of herself through the ups and downs of a life that isn’t always Instagram-ready.&nbsp;</p>

<p>COVID seems to be an opportunity for us to see the world for how it really runs: us being able to stay in isolation and live with unchanged fundamental qualities relies on countless people working to keep the system going — supermarket workers, NHS workers, postmen, care workers, binmen and food couriers. The dialectical and cynical interpretation is: in normal circumstances, they are others that we fail to see as human, for they have been, in a greater sense, symbolised as a service, a function, a cog in the machine.</p>



<p>Are we becoming more indifferent? The dilemma is: we do feel and express our fury and pity for food couriers being exploited online (see the Twitter result for ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=deliveroo%20exploit&amp;src=typed_query">Deliveroo</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Uber%20Eats%20exploit&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">Uber Eats</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Just%20Eat%20exploit&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">Just Eat exploit</a>’], but at the end of the day, our direct interest in when our food will arrive and why stuff is missing will still override any interest in the life-stories of the person making it happen.</p>



<p>It seems like our imaginations of others are dissolved in “paying for a service”. Jonathon Nunn, the editor of the food newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://vittles.substack.com/"><em>Vittle</em></a>, and a former Uber Eats courier says by taking out, “anything extraneous to making quick profits — decor, location, front of house staff, anything that cultivates hospitality in a restaurant” — delivery apps streamline the restaurant to a faceless entity solely about delivering a service: the selling of food. And when a courier arrives at your front door, there’s no need for interaction other than just taking the food and a formulaic thank you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1-1024x678.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-723" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1-768x508.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1-1600x1059.jpg 1600w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1-1200x794.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/man-6917326_1920-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image provided by <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/man-bicycle-food-delivery-6917326/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pixabay.com/photos/man-bicycle-food-delivery-6917326/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Our unquenchable thirst for the easiest life possible, and the aim of the delivery apps to fulfil it, “come at the expense of all these relationships [between the customers, the restaurants and the couriers] which have been reduced entirely to their transactional nature”, says Jonathon.</p>



<p>The reason he never uses delivery apps, he told me, is that he thinks: “The restaurant is really one of the last spaces where people come face to face with the people who are providing them with labour. Slowly, every social interaction has been chiselled away — booking apps so you don&#8217;t have to ring up and speak to someone, delivery services so you don&#8217;t need to speak with front of house, dark kitchens so back of house is even spatially hidden away.”</p>



<p>A theory about the uniforms of a company is proposed in Ken Loach’s film,&nbsp;<em>Bread and Roses(2000)</em>: they “make us invisible”. Twenty years after, our modern world has taken one step further, making the labour truly invisible but under surveillance — “the working people just become a little tracker on your screen”, says Jonathan.</p>

<p>The writer, <a href="http://www.barclaybram.com/words">Barclay Bram</a> uses “<a href="https://granta.com/the-knowledge/">frictionless</a>” to describe this form of digital ease and points out: alongside the convenience, “we have this massive loneliness pandemic”. “As much as we gain, we also have to understand what we lose,” says Barclay, “The more these platforms take over, the less you feel a part of it, you&#8217;re just an atom in that system.</p>



<p>“By creating these kinds of platforms, and turning workers into their own kind of mini brand, working individually for the algorithm, you stratify that work so much.” And somehow in the name of the division of labour, absolute inequality gets naturalised.</p>



<p>“It all comes down to this&#8230;” says Barclay, at the end of our interview pointing at one guy with his bright blue Deliveroo bag. He is hunching over on the edge of a flower bed, waiting to pick up an order from the restaurant across. “He’s not being paid right now, but he&#8217;s at work, right? And I&#8217;m at work right now. I stepped out for coffee, but I have a salary and that’s really powerful. It means that there&#8217;s some sense of protection about what I do, and value and respect. But everyone should have that. All jobs should look like that on some level.”</p>



<p>By binding the self-employed status of the courier to notions like “voluntariness” and “reciprocity”, Deliveroo has managed to erase holiday pay, sick pay, fuel and vehicle costs, and payment for any time the courier isn’t spending on delivering. The company is famous for providing flexibility and not paying its couriers minimum wage. One-third of its couriers made on average&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-03-25/deliveroo-riders-earning-as-little-as-2-pounds">less than £8.72</a>&nbsp;according to a 2021 survey of over 300 couriers by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-03-25/deliveroo-riders-earning-as-little-as-2-pounds">Deliveroo</a>&nbsp;insists on this sample to be “not a meaningful or representative proportion” for couriers are not required to work in an hourly pattern so the average pay should be calculated “from the moment a rider accepts a Deliveroo order until they complete the order”. Having no rights to employee benefits articulates the choice left for couriers fairly clearly during the pandemic — “go to the streets to work anyway” says Tiago Contieri, who gets a living by juggling between Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Stuart Delivery and Ryde for “you can’t make enough money” using one app in London.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1623123096602-35c9aabf9407?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=987&amp;q=80" alt="" width="610" height="915"/><figcaption>Image provided by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/vKbqctqiZEg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://unsplash.com/photos/vKbqctqiZEg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Upsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tiago, from Brazil, started working as a Deliveroo courier soon after he came to the UK in 2019 “because apparently it was a good option to start working for someone from abroad” and he says that what he makes from Deliveroo, nowadays, is around £80-90 for 10 hours working with no breaks. “It’s basically slavery working for delivery apps if you work by bicycle,” he says.</p>



<p>If you live in London, you wouldn’t need to order many times to notice that couriers are predominantly migrants — “this is quite different to the image that Deliveroo tried to push for a long time that young, white students would deliver your food on a bicycle” says Dr&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jamiewoodcock.net/">Jamie Woodcock</a>, the author of <a href="https://www.uwestminsterpress.co.uk/site/books/m/10.16997/book51/">The Fight Against Platform Capitalism</a>, “Many of these workers are excluded from other kinds of employment. And their migration status is often one of the sources of their exploitation.”</p>



<p>Food couriers have finally been recognised as essential workers in the pandemic, but despite the verbal elevation, there hasn’t been any rise in their working conditions. JustEat’s subcontractor, Stuart Delivery, cut the minimum delivery pay in Sheffield by 24%, from £4.50 to £3.40 on 6 December 2021. This triggered the&nbsp;<a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/justeat-greggs">longest gig-economy strike</a>&nbsp;by local couriers which is still ongoing to this day.</p>



<p>Deliveroo got its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in London in March 2021 with an investment from Amazon in the anticipation that it will stay till the end-game and become the gatekeeper of the industry. It has indeed robustly expanded its UK market share to 77% at the end of 2021 from 53% at the end of 2020. But Tiago says: “They’re paying less than they actually used to pay before, which is funny as all prices are rising in the UK. It was really rare to have a delivery fee of £2.90 in the past on Deliveroo but now it’s something normal. It used to be always more than £3.”</p>



<p>But there are also couriers very satisfied with the job. Shajon Hussain, worked at the Soho Sandwich factory when he first moved to the UK from Bangladesh about half a year ago before he took up the delivery work. It could take him three hours on the train and bus to work. Despite leaving home at 4 am., he was often late due to unpredictable traffic problems, which angered his boss. The job was paid approximately £1100 per month, but now he keeps a weekly income of £450-600 with Deliveroo and Uber Eats. “If it&#8217;s busy, I work. If not, I come back. It’s flexible. It’s self-employment, you know?” he says.</p>

<p>Either precarious flexible self-employment or stable inflexible employment, this is our common default assumption. But Dr Woodcock says, “there&#8217;s no reason why employment can&#8217;t be flexible. Apart from employers not wanting it to be flexible.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Independent Workers&#8217; Union of Great Britain (IWGB)&nbsp;has been fighting through courts to reclassify couriers as limb (b), an existing non-binary employment status in the UK, which subjects independent workers to basic employment rights. But last year’s Court of Appeal <a href="https://dwfgroup.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2021/7/deliveroo-court-of-appeal-finds-riders-are-not-in-an-employment-relationship#:~:text=In%20a%20unanimous%20judgment,%20the,European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">rejected IWGB’s appeal for the fourth time</a>, for one term in Deliveroo’s contract: it is allowed to have a different person using the same courier account, which contradicts the personal performance obligation in&nbsp;the definition of employees under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights-act/article-11-freedom-assembly-and-association#:~:text=Everyone%20has%20the%20right%20to,the%20protection%20of%20his%20interests.">Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a>.</p>



<p>Throughout history, every tech advancement brings in a labour market reform with jobs catering to the new way of production, i.e. the interest of the factories and companies, and decades later, the workers rise up with demonstrations to articulate their interests and rights. This process sometimes needs generations to fuel up. What’s perhaps cheeringly surprising in this cycle of platform work is how it has happened incredibly quickly.</p>



<p>The IWGB has done incredible work&nbsp;<a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-wins-groundbreaking-health-and-safety-legal-challenge-against-the-government">winning gig workers</a><a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-wins-groundbreaking-health-and-safety-legal-challenge-against-the-government"> health and safety protections</a>, and worker status for&nbsp;<a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-wins-worker-status-and-rights-for-gig-economy-citysprint-couriers-once-and-for-all">CitySprint&nbsp;couriers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/landmark-legal-victory-opens-door-to-worker-rights-for-uk-foster-carers">foster care workers</a>, but there is little more that can be done to safeguard the rights of couriers under current domestic laws that fully allow Deliveroo to escape liability and do not take into account the nuances of gig work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s about how as a society, we can think through the bargain of work”, says Dr Woodcock, “It’s about having a political debate about whether employment law works in the way it does now, whether the tax system works for supporting people, whether labour market enforcement is working in the right way, and seeing that that kind of collective discussion and voice is what drives forward work.”</p>



<p>The on-demand delivery industry is aggressively expanding, copying the model to other services like grocery, laundry, manicurists, salons, parking and so on. Uberisation is happening.</p>



<p>As Dr Woodcock says: “If we don&#8217;t do something about it now, that model will spread out to the rest of the economy. And it&#8217;s very difficult to change things after that&#8217;s happened.”</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><em>An old man who persists in feeding pigeons in Elephant &amp; Castle once said to me: “London is big, so big that you are invisible.”&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>In my own case, it&#8217;s my second year in London. As an extremely introverted foreigner, any slight sign of unwelcome sends me scurrying back into my shell and consoling myself with the inherent “outsider” status. But the pandemic had me rethink my way of living and eager to get to know the city, the other side of the city.</p>



<p>Who is in the street in the dead of night? Who are these people that are, in a factual sense, unseen by most people? What are they doing?</p>



<p>I took a night stroll to see it myself. My journey started at 2:50 am, from elephant &amp; Castle, on March 13th.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2:54 am.</span> I was greeted by two full streams of traffic. Cars came one after another incessantly. Pavements were scattered with people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The melancholy I had just laid out for the anticipated lonely night walk was shattered by the spectacular flow of traffic in front of me.</p>



<p>There were still many pedestrians around, and the bus stop was as crowded as it was during the day.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:05 am</span>. I turned to the small path, the Elephant Road, that cut through the roundabout, where the train station was. If the traffic just now could be described as busy, this place was simply bustling. Crowds were outside the Latin nightclub, The Pool Lounge. The brickwork filtered out the music but not the drumbeats — thumping your eardrum in rhythm, with occasional horns rang up and indistinct chattering bursting out laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It made me wonder if it was really at late night? </p>



<p>But you would notice that despite the richness of the sounds, you could clearly identify where they were coming from — it was quiet enough for the superimposition of these sounds to stay as a multi-part ensemble, rather than a brain-rattling muddle like in the daytime.</p>



<p>A van arrived, a team of orange-clad railway workers filed out. Marching&nbsp;to the&nbsp;muffled drumbeat, they set to work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="699" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-1024x699.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-545" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-300x205.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-768x524.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-1536x1049.jpg 1536w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-2048x1398.jpg 2048w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-1600x1092.jpg 1600w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-1200x819.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/9-1980x1352.jpg 1980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:12 am.</span> Though the shutter was down, the shop was open 24 hours a day. A customer was buying cigarettes through the fence.</p>



<p>As soon as you leave the Elephant &amp; Castle roundabout (where bus stops, train station, underground station and vehicles were all located), pedestrians dwindled and the traffic changed from dizzying streams that made u doubt the time to the occasional car or two.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:13 am.</span> Except for nightclubs and corner shops, most places were closed. An empty pub had just been cleaned — the chairs were placed upside down on the tables. The lights were off, leaving only the counter light to illuminate a waiter tidying up the bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The popular dating app Tinder was founded by Sean Rad in 2012. By 2014, it had an estimated one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/fashion/tinder-the-fast-growing-dating-app-taps-an-age-old-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billion</a> daily swipes. This was just the beginning of a huge cultural shift towards a digital age of dating. A world of swiping and matching was quickly born; one fuelled by a reliance on instant gratification and the chance of a quick shag, simply by clicking a few buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the invention of Tinder, many cunning entrepreneurs followed suit, eyeing up the opportunity to capitalise of us singletons’ quest for love, and an array of other dating apps were created: Hinge, Bumble, Grindr, and Thursday to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although genuine relationships have been found through dating apps, they have also become a site of disappointment, where hook-up culture is normalised. Whilst the de-stigmatisation of casual sex and pleasure undeniably has its positives, research suggests that online dating could be negatively affecting our experiences of love, sex, and intimacy, as physcotherapist Andrea Freira<em> </em>explains how and why our emotional needs might not be being met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s Friday night and I’m getting ready for a date with a guy I’ve matched on Hinge. He looked perfectly normal. Attractive. Nice eyes and smile. Good dress sense. His profile had the right ratio of selfies and pictures with friends and family, confirming he wasn’t a serial killer. We chatted for a couple of days and seemed to have a lot in common, so decided to go to the pub.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now six pints, a hangover, and a ghost later, I’m wondering where it all went wrong. If you’re fortunate enough to not know what ghosting is, the urban dictionary coins it as, “a person cutting off all communication with zero warning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That week, the front room of my shared house was host to many feminist chats, with me the angry ringleader. I was consoled by the girls that of course, this was his loss; that there was nothing wrong with me. However, it wasn’t insecurity or fear of rejection that was niggling at me. I was genuinely confused by the online dating world and the lies that seemed to accompany it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a newly single person, I was totally unfamiliar with the convoluted subtext that came with dating. “I’d love to take you on another date” seems to translate as “You will literally never hear from me again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m not the only one. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/" target="_blank">study</a> directed by the Pew Research Centre found that 45% of online daters were left feeling frustrated by the experience, compared with a mere 28% that felt hopeful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could we, Gen Z, be quite literally fucked?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are the generation that have grown up with an endless pool of options, in all aspects of life. Netflix presents us with a dizzying array of entertainment, where the maximum effort required is moving your fingers to remote. To accompany our movie night, we click a few buttons, and a McDonalds magically appears at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="697" height="392" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-525" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg 697w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><figcaption>Popular dating app, Tinder. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The notion of minimum input, maximum output, has unfortunately trickled into our love lives. As 19-year-old Tinder-user <em>Honor Newman</em> explains: “One of the issues with dating apps is that it’s so easy to find somebody. You don’t have to put it any effort. It’s not a chase, it’s just there you go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The art of communication is being lost in translation. When singles enter the online dating world and meet their match, there is no blueprint stating how serious a connection that person is looking for. (Unless of course, they write it on their profile, which is a rarity.) “I think more men use Tinder for a quick shag, to just have sex with lots of different people really easily,” says Newman. “Women aren’t necessarily just looking for sex, we actually want to find somebody.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When two people are online dating with different intentions and not communicating, problems can arise. Communication issues can of course also occur in same-sex relationships, but psycho-therapist Andrea Freira explains the part gender roles play when it comes to heterosexual dating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The male and female brains are wired differently, so biologically speaking we are different, women are a lot more attuned with their emotional side. Men often go into dating with less expectations and that’s sometimes where the conflict occurs, as men are perhaps just looking to get to know you and are typically a lot harder to get to commit to a relationship than women are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a vast majority of men are using these apps just to find different sexual partners, it’s no wonder emotional connections and meaningful relationships are not being found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that occurs when using dating apps is the immense build-up. Often, when you match with someone online, you start to create an idea of that person in your head, creating a false narrative of what you think they’re like – or, what you want them to be like. This is where meeting a potential partner in person, as opposed to on a dating app, could be more beneficial. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you are meeting someone in real life you can use your intuition to guide you, whereas when you are engaging or getting to know someone online there is always an expectation,” Freira explains. “Usually, people go into online dating with an outcome in their mind. Whereas as if you were able to go into it just looking to know that person and experience that person, without any expectation of an outcome it could be a lot more fulfilling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, perhaps it’s not all doom and gloom. Perhaps it’s about actively changing our mindsets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>There is </strong><strong>still </strong><strong>hope.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the many of us still single and exasperated online-daters, there are a notable number of couples whose modern love-stories began at the swipe of a finger. According to The Future of Dating <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eharmony.co.uk/dating-advice/dating/the-future-of-dating-report-2018-smart-devices-to-predict-if-your-relationship-is-on-the-rocks/" target="_blank">report</a> by The Imperial College Business School and eHarmony, 32% of relationships that started between 2015 and 2019 met online, and by 2035 they estimate that more than 50% of couples will have met through online dating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is 21-year-old *Katie Thomas* who met her now boyfriend on Hinge. After over a year on the app with no luck and a string of unsuccessful matches, she explains how this time was different.&nbsp; &#8220;He made it clear from the get-go what he wanted. There was no messing around, there was no game playing,&#8221; she says. Communication was key from the offset. “There was consistent effort on his part, which gave me the space to also put effort in and be honest without feeling silly or feeling like it wasn’t going to go anywhere.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer could be in the way we approach online-dating and the kind of communication we use. As Freira says, “It can work if two people can go into it with the right mindset and allow things to develop and really enjoy getting to know the other person. Go into it with an open mind and don’t attach yourselves to any potential outcome. Just allow it to just flow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making a conscious effort to have no pre-conceptions about your match while being communicative and honest from the beginning, could be key in using dating apps to your full advantage, and not hurting anyone else in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Learn to love the skin you&#8217;re in, without having to change it.</strong></em></p>



<p>When you google acne, a million and one websites appear selling treatments and products that promise to miraculously clear your skin. Drink four litres of water every day, sleep with silk pillowcases, shot apple cider vinegar every morning and spend thousands on chemical peels. </p>



<p>The information comes at you from every angle, and it can be extremely overwhelming. Not to mention that they’re usually based off no factual data or scientific evidence.</p>



<p>Having suffered with acne for the last six years of my life, I have felt the desperation that led me to try all these tips and tricks off random women on the internet. None of which worked.</p>



<p>Since I was 16, I have tried multiple medications, treatments, and home remedies and despite all of this I still have acne. At times it really improves. Then out of nowhere new spots appear, and my confidence plummets back down to below zero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cycle continues.</p>



<p>Now at 22, after the hard realisation that the acne isn’t going anywhere just yet, I had to change the way I viewed myself. For my mental health’s sake, I have done a lot of work on my inner-self, and I now spend less time trying and failing to ‘fix’ my skin.</p>



<p>Instead, I have learnt to love the skin I’m in, regardless of its appearance. As contrary to popular belief, we don’t have that much control over the appearance of our skin. But we can control our mindset.</p>



<p>Here are some simple steps to help change the way you view yourself and your skin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Try and Go Makeup Free</u></strong></p>



<p>I know the thought may seem daunting. I really struggle to leave the house without makeup, especially when my acne has flared up particularly badly. Makeup serves as a safety blanket, and concealer my best friend. When I’ve covered my face with a thick layer of paint, I can be blemish free, and I instantly feel more confident.</p>



<p>I know that feeling of insecurities creeping in all too well. &nbsp;It can make the thought of heading out the door bare faced seem almost impossible, even if you are just popping to Tesco. You worry that everyone will be looking at your skin, viewing you as unattractive or even dirty.</p>



<p>To unlearn that clear skin equals beautiful, I try to go make-up free some days, to find my confidence from within. One day this week, I challenge you to try it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll go first.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/acne-final-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-600" width="611" height="611"/><figcaption>Personal Image</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Do Not Avoid Socialising</u></strong></p>



<p>Socialising can be really anxiety provoking when you have acne. I can remember quite a few times I have said no to seeing my friends because my skin was having a flare up. I was worried about what people might think of me.</p>



<p>One Saturday night a few years ago and I was getting ready to go out with my friends. I put concealer on, then foundation. Then powder. More powder. Nothing would cover my spots. I looked in the mirror and all I could see was my acne.</p>



<p>I was so exhausted and angry. I scrubbed at my face with a wipe, until the makeup was all off. I was about to start re-applying but with a heavier foundation this time when I caught my reflection in the mirror.</p>



<p>I gave up, and I didn’t go out. I was so worried that all people would look at was my acne. I missed out on a night of drinking, dancing, and making memories with my friends. I regret all the times I cancelled plans because I was insecure about my skin.</p>



<p>In reality no-one is even looking, let alone judging.</p>



<p>So, go out and have fun. Don’t let your skin get in the way of your life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Filter Who You Follow</u></strong></p>



<p>Social media can be a toxic place. Scrolling all day on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok is unsurprisingly bad for our mental health. But if you suffer with acne, it can be even worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of filters and airbrushing creates a false narrative that everyone, everywhere, has ‘perfect’ skin.</p>



<p>No spots. No skin texture. Just smooth, glowing, tanned blemish-free faces.</p>



<p>Social media is lying to us all.</p>



<p>Constantly seeing ‘perfect’ skin every time you open the app can be really difficult for people who suffer with skin problems. So, if Instagram is making you feel insecure, it might be useful to have a re-think of who you follow.</p>



<p>Go through the accounts on your feed and ask yourself, ‘Does this person make me feel good or bad about myself?’ If the answer is bad, you know what to do.</p>



<p>There are also lots of skin positive accounts on Instagram, where people share their journey with acne. Following these has really helped me find my confidence. It’s refreshing to see selfies with spots, scarring and skin texture. It reminds you that you are not alone, and that acne is much more common than you might think.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Positive Skin Affirmations</u></strong></p>



<p>When my skin is bad, I sometimes find myself looking in the mirror and speaking so negatively about myself in my head.</p>



<p>‘Your acne is back.’ ‘You look disgusting.’ ‘You need to cover up your skin.’</p>



<p>I grasped what I was doing, and realised I needed to change this. Why am I putting myself down? If one of my friends had acne, would I say this to them? After asking myself these questions, I realised that I needed to start using positive affirmations instead.</p>



<p>Now, when I look I the mirror, particularly if I am having a bad skin day, I start my morning with some positive affirmations.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, I know saying affirmations isn’t going to change my skin or confidence overnight. But, if you are consistent with them, it can have a hugely positive effect on your self-esteem and thinking pattern.</p>



<p>Positive affirmations are a way of actively swapping a negative mindset for a positive one.&nbsp; For example, if I’m feeling insecure about my acne I might say, ‘I feel happy in my skin.’</p>



<p>Here are some skin affirmations you can try:</p>



<p>My skin is beautiful.</p>



<p>My skin protects me.</p>



<p>My skin is healing.</p>



<p>I am becoming more comfortable with my imperfections.</p>



<p>My skin does not define me.</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Amid increasing gentrification affecting areas of East London, residents of Brick Lane risk having the same fate of their ancestors: leaving.</strong></em></p>



<p>Building, that&#8217;s what bricks are for. Since their invention, prior to 7500 BC, bricks have become a viable alternative in construction. But they have also gained a poignant meaning in history that is synonymous with peoples, families. Arrivals, departures, encounters. Because, with bricks, dwellings are built, bridges are erected, markets and community centres are created, roads are levelled, connecting and putting a place on the map, giving it life, presence, relevance.</p>



<p>On Brick Lane, and in the areas of Spitalfields and Tower Hamlets in East London, bricks have become the idiosyncratic allegory of centuries of traditions, communities. Growth, blended with stability. A stability achieved through inclusivity, acceptance, and a flow of transformations that, in the course of its existence, marked it to the point of becoming a crossroads open to all and in the heart of everyone.</p>



<p>“I have always been here,” said Rahad Miah, who works at the popular Bengal Village, while listening to traditional Bengali music in the background. “I was used to coming when I was a kid and I am still here.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image007-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-733" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image007-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image007-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image007-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image007.jpg 1111w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Photo by Simone Pellegrino.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A field path in the countryside outside the City of London in 1500s, the street welcomed early Flemish settlers, whose brick kilns gave it its characteristic name. But it was not until the second half of 17<sup>th</sup> century, when other roads were laid out, that the area started developing and taking its modern, urban appearance.</p>



<p>Among other buildings, breweries popped up prosperously. The largest site, extended over the centuries, was bought by Joseph Truman in 1676 and kept actively producing beer until the end of 1990s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-965" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg 1516w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The Old Truman Brewery. Photo by Simone Pellegrino.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Currently owned by the Zeloof partnership, the complex has been used by small independent businesses as well as grassroots creative and cultural organisations. </p>



<p>In September 2021, the latest chapter of a long story of mutations began. A local committee approved <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/documents/s190863/Appendix%201%20-%20PA2000415%20-%20DC%20Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">plans</a> for a 5-story development that would replace part of the Old Truman brewery with offices and brand-name chain shops.</p>



<p>For years, the area suffered corporate developments spreading from the richer City of London. This affected local communities with rising living costs and consequent displacement, as if the place their ancestors created took them back to their initial, mutual condition: leaving.</p>



<p>From 1680s onwards, a large community of Protestant Huguenots fleeing from persecutions in France moved to the area. Their textile skills and the fabrics brought from cities such as Nantes and Lyon enabled the district to emerge in weaving and garment making.</p>



<p>Their religion, which finally found relief in Huguenot Church on Brick Lane, co-existed with Anglicanism professed in the nearby Christ Church on Commercial Street.</p>



<p>These two faiths were joined first by the Jewish community of Ashkenazi and Yiddish-speaking Russian Jews sheltering from the wave of anti-Semitic pogroms in 19<sup>th</sup>&#8211; and 20<sup>th</sup>-century Eastern Europe and, more recently, by a large number of Muslim Bangladeshi Bengalis.</p>



<p>The latter, who left their land at the height of the war of independence from Pakistan, would work in the thriving local tailoring industry or open some of the iconic curry restaurants that even led to informally call the area ‘Banglatown’.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, bricks would keep changing their face as time went by. They would take on the colour of the graffiti that would often cover them, the scent of the fumes that would reach them from the kitchens, the taste of a pint of beer brewed in the district and spilled on the ground.</p>



<p>“It changed a lot,” said Miah. “Many of Bengalis left the area, many restaurants closed and the choice is not that diversified anymore.”</p>



<p>According to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/204259709/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/204259709/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted by Centre on The Dynamics of Ethnicity and Runnymede Trust to gauge the current state of Brick Lane and its ethnical diversity, 17 restaurants have closed since 2014, leaving only 22 eateries open.</p>



<p>Ironically, it is as if the action of building has also inherent its own contradiction. While it is true that bricks are employed to erect bridges, they are also used to raise walls, to establish watchtowers from which to flush out the enemy and, as in the case of Brick Lane, to feed the dangerous greed that might turn ‘building’ into the equivalent of ‘demolishing’.</p>

<p>Although the process, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://battleforbricklane.com/the-threat" data-type="URL" data-id="https://battleforbricklane.com/the-threat" target="_blank">deemed</a> soulless by critics, followed the more common paradigm of what is described as gentrification, it also jeopardised the particular urban character of the district, and caused the loss of meaningful places.</p>



<p>According to <a href="http://classonline.org.uk/docs/Pushed_to_the_Margins_Gentrification_report_v5.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://classonline.org.uk/docs/Pushed_to_the_Margins_Gentrification_report_v5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> conducted by Centre for Labour and Social Studies and Runnymede Trust, the borough of Tower Hamlets was among those which gentrified most between 2010 and 2014.</p>



<p>In Brick Lane, “there are common dynamics of gentrification in increasing profits by improving the building stock and upgrading their usage for higher-rank users,” said Dr Ryan Centner, who is Assistant Professor of Urban Geographies in the Department of Geography and Environment at LSE. “But its gentrification has been influenced by a form of <em>tourist-ification</em>, in turning the place into a touristic attraction.” </p>



<p>Prior to the pandemic, more than 18,500 pedestrians walked along the street on an average day, according to <a href="https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/News_events/2021/August-2021/Welcome-Back-Brick-Lane.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> provided by Tower Hamlets council, making it one of London&#8217;s main cultural destinations.</p>



<p>In a statement released in April 2021, Jason Zeloof, on behalf of the partnership, had denied that the site would be transformed into a shopping mall, and had declared that his association would offer 20% of space to independent stores.</p>



<p>If some wait for an uncertain future with hope, many other residents decry the institutional carelessness for their concerns over the plan, which were repeatedly raised through protests and campaigning on social media.</p>

<p>A shopping centre would let Brick Lane become a “much more congested place” and lose its unpretentious nature, said Rahad Miah.</p>



<p>Mahbuba Sultana, who works in her family business in the Upmarket space of the Old Truman Brewery, seemed to disagree. </p>



<p>“A shopping mall would help us see more faces,” she said. “It would be like Westfield, where people have everything in one place.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-740" width="610" height="457" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001.jpg 833w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>Mahbuba Sultana and her family kiosk in the Upmarket.

<p>With living costs already sitting at record high levels, the new development would further revamp the population of the area.</p>



<p>“The mall inevitably would bring a change in the demographics of residents, more businesses, like premium brands, an increase in local jobs, and a surge in rent and prices that will likely be slightly higher than the average growth in London,” said Austin Walker, who is a Sales Negotiator for real estate services provider Savills.</p>



<p>While the project got approved, its progress will depend on the outcome of a judicial review that campaigners from the Save Brick Lane coalition, created to fight the threats of gentrification for the local community, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/planning/401-planning-news/49501-high-court-gives-permission-for-judicial-review-over-impact-of-development-on-diversity-and-character-of-brick-lane-area" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/planning/401-planning-news/49501-high-court-gives-permission-for-judicial-review-over-impact-of-development-on-diversity-and-character-of-brick-lane-area" target="_blank">have been granted</a> by the High Court.</p>



<p>The group even started a crowdfunding initiative on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-brick-lane/" target="_blank">CrowdJustice</a> to cover costly legal fees and sustain their action against Tower Hamlets council. At the time of writing, donations topped £10,000.</p>



<p>On top of the burden that gentrification put on local residents and businesses, the backlash of Brexit might be the finishing blow. Curry houses were reportedly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/bangladeshi-caterers-association-calls-on-mps-to-throw-out-brexit-3612080" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/bangladeshi-caterers-association-calls-on-mps-to-throw-out-brexit-3612080" target="_blank">forced to close</a>, as visa rules were toughened amid a general clampdown on immigrants.</p>



<p>“Everything got expensive and it became very hard to survive,” said Forhad Ahmed, who manages an off-license on Brick Lane. “Brexit forgot the foreigners of this country.”</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><em>As the pandemic reshaped our conception of love and relationships, the words of American author bell hooks are more prevalent than ever. </em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-primary-color has-text-color">As I sit down at my dining table a week from spending another Valentine’s alone, listening to the gospel of Eric Clapton, I can’t help but wonder: was bell hooks right? Is young culture today cynical about love? Are we really creating a culture of 20 something un-romantics who can name the strangest of kinks, but cringe at the thought of love?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2000, the book <em>All About Love: New Visions</em> had explored love in modern society. Twenty-two years later, amid post-covid and digital love youth,&nbsp;the&nbsp;work remains current. GenZers&nbsp;have found a false sense of comfort in a culture of hook-ups, instant gratification, cynicism and isolation. Was bell hooks right, are we too cynical to truly love?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being young is hard. In the face of a looming climate crisis, flop governments and post-covid anxiety, it is not a surprise that love is tough to find. Young people are letting go of the quest for love and intimacy, as bell hooks says ahead of her time: cynicism is the great mask of the disappointed and betrayed heart. </p>



<p>We are a generation whose connection to love has been warped by hook-up culture, sex-orientated TV shows, dating app companies which thrive on loneliness and two whole years of almost pure isolation. So, I joined&nbsp;a group of GenZers, Tristan (19), Tasia (19), Karis (20) and Kiera (19), who were ready to explore their own ideas and connection to loving whilst young. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Five young individuals gathered with two bottles of wine between us wondering and delving into the effects of being without love. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“<strong>That shit [love] is gone, there is nowhere to meet people organically, everyone is just trying to fuck,” said Tristan.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It’s a lonely world out there for GenZers, especially those who don’t partake in hook-up culture. Even non-romantic love is a struggle, with social media becoming our ever-present judge on our image, education and careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are more focused on how we stand in a capitalist world than building communities and long-lasting relationships. “It’s not just romantic love that is lost, it’s also self-love. Everyone is too cynical,” says 20-year-old Karis, “Social media and growing cynicism is not only damaging our love lives, but also the love that we have for ourselves.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most young people aren’t even comfortable speaking about love. It is easier to get young people to speak about favourite sex positions than to get them to tell their friends ‘I love you.’ &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can speak about love but only in my inner circles,” says Tristan, who easily told me about his&nbsp;sexual encounters, but stuttered when trying to define love. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a generation that is studious when it comes to sex positivity but emotionally stunted at the topic of love: it is no surprise that young people have essentially dropped out of the race for love. It requires commitment, longevity and truthfulness. But who could blame us , when social media companies have shaped dating into a swift finger motion of purely aestheticism and desirability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is it even possible to commit when you are just a three second image on a person’s smart phone? Instant gratification over long-term commitment defines our generation. Food deliveries instead of cooking, next-day shipping and seven-second TikTok videos. All life changing conveniences: the prize of the modern world, a double-edged sword that corrupts our attention spans and willingness to commit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every one of my interviewees were on dating apps. Their faces looked disappointed when I asked the dreaded question, which we all know well, ‘Have you found someone?’&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiera, the only one who has been in a relationship (for 4 and a half years,) described them as ‘a chore.’&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t feel like love is lost amongst young people, deep down it is what majority of us want,” she said with such hopefulness that maybe only someone in a loving relationship could conceive. Her and her boyfriend were high-school sweethearts, their&nbsp;love was organic, and their brains still uncorrupted by the anti-love tech giants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there, it can be possible for young people to commit to love. Kiera’s testimony gives us a momentary glimmer into the idea of love still existing in our culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then comes Covid-19, two years of isolation and complete digital submergence, it feels like if any of us had hope for putting ourselves out there, it was all out of the window. Isolation physically stopped us from interacting and making long-term intimate connections. </p>



<p>“Quarantine made me feel more comfortable with the idea of being by myself,” says Tasia, as the energy of the group simmered down as the wine was reaching an end. “It doesn’t seem like there is any time to build a whole new intimate relationship” and&nbsp;the idea of committing to a new relationship, as the world around you is reaching Armageddon, seems like a prison sentence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Life feels like it’s slipping fast. According to Tristan, “Relationships seem like they always have an inevitable ending”. In a post-pandemic world where we were cruelly shown that we have no control over our lives, young people want stability and comfort in things that aren’t as big of a gamble as relationships seem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To love or not to love, that is the question. There are many ways of looking at it. bell hooks tells us to love, as a generous heart is always open. American actress&nbsp;Jenny Slate says she would rather live with a tender heart, for it is the key to finding love. Eric Clapton sings “You just don’t realise how much I love you”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Love and loving are natural to human existence. The very first thing we do as we enter the world is love, as we are held by our mothers and see their loving eyes for the first time, all the way until we lay on our death bed and have the loves of our lives flash before our eyes as the very last thing we do. As young people we shouldn’t lose all hope on finding love. As the leaders of the world to come, building our communities on all things encompassing love should be a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><em><strong>If you will not let us into your spaces, we will create our own.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>LGBTQ+ and Ethnic communities struggle to find places where they feel welcome and can party and drink without the fear of being &#8216;othered&#8217; and alienated because of who they are and how they present. It is rare to find spaces that are controlled and populated by members of the LGBTQBIPOC community. Even the clubs that solely exist for the LGBTQ+ communities end up infiltrated and demonised by white cis-hetro fragile men. Or they exclude BIPOC members of the community. So to piss them off more, here is a list of the top 5 LGBTQBIPOC friendly clubs for the community and they actually have good music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A sober club night centred around healing and inclusion for LGBTQBPOC members, Misery Party focuses on healing workshops, nail bars and a resident DJ for their sober and uplifting club nights. Misery invites the members of the community who don’t partake in drinking culture and are still trying to find their tribe. To come as you are even if you are struggling with your mental health, substance abuse, or are ultimately just quiet, sad and want to have a good time.  Misery is truly a communal space who work on decolonising and de-capitalising the club space whilst uplifting LGBTQBPOC in the meantime.  </p>
