<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><em>An old man who persists in feeding pigeons in Elephant &amp; Castle once said to me: “London is big, so big that you are invisible.”&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>In my own case, it&#8217;s my second year in London. As an extremely introverted foreigner, any slight sign of unwelcome sends me scurrying back into my shell and consoling myself with the inherent “outsider” status. But the pandemic had me rethink my way of living and eager to get to know the city, the other side of the city.</p>



<p>Who is in the street in the dead of night? Who are these people that are, in a factual sense, unseen by most people? What are they doing?</p>



<p>I took a night stroll to see it myself. My journey started at 2:50 am, from elephant &amp; Castle, on March 13th.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2:54 am.</span> I was greeted by two full streams of traffic. Cars came one after another incessantly. Pavements were scattered with people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The melancholy I had just laid out for the anticipated lonely night walk was shattered by the spectacular flow of traffic in front of me.</p>



<p>There were still many pedestrians around, and the bus stop was as crowded as it was during the day.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:05 am</span>. I turned to the small path, the Elephant Road, that cut through the roundabout, where the train station was. If the traffic just now could be described as busy, this place was simply bustling. Crowds were outside the Latin nightclub, The Pool Lounge. The brickwork filtered out the music but not the drumbeats — thumping your eardrum in rhythm, with occasional horns rang up and indistinct chattering bursting out laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It made me wonder if it was really at late night? </p>



<p>But you would notice that despite the richness of the sounds, you could clearly identify where they were coming from — it was quiet enough for the superimposition of these sounds to stay as a multi-part ensemble, rather than a brain-rattling muddle like in the daytime.</p>



<p>A van arrived, a team of orange-clad railway workers filed out. Marching&nbsp;to the&nbsp;muffled drumbeat, they set to work.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:12 am.</span> Though the shutter was down, the shop was open 24 hours a day. A customer was buying cigarettes through the fence.</p>



<p>As soon as you leave the Elephant &amp; Castle roundabout (where bus stops, train station, underground station and vehicles were all located), pedestrians dwindled and the traffic changed from dizzying streams that made u doubt the time to the occasional car or two.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:13 am.</span> Except for nightclubs and corner shops, most places were closed. An empty pub had just been cleaned — the chairs were placed upside down on the tables. The lights were off, leaving only the counter light to illuminate a waiter tidying up the bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3:18 am.</span> Away from the main roads, the night sank into lonesome gloom broken by a singing red rickshaw.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><em><strong>If you will not let us into your spaces, we will create our own.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>LGBTQ+ and Ethnic communities struggle to find places where they feel welcome and can party and drink without the fear of being &#8216;othered&#8217; and alienated because of who they are and how they present. It is rare to find spaces that are controlled and populated by members of the LGBTQBIPOC community. Even the clubs that solely exist for the LGBTQ+ communities end up infiltrated and demonised by white cis-hetro fragile men. Or they exclude BIPOC members of the community. So to piss them off more, here is a list of the top 5 LGBTQBIPOC friendly clubs for the community and they actually have good music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now Juice London is the black LGBTQ+ party you will want to be at. It is black owned and features amazing DJs and music: an all-round spectacular place to find yourself on a night in Soho. The club runs events and parties all year round and continuously uplifts and supports members of the Black LGBTQ+ communities through Instagram posts.</p>

<p>From being only open once a month to now a fully venue house party located under the Vauxhall arches, LICK is now notorious amongst the femme and non-binary club goers. It isn’t a place for cisgendered men, that’s right they are <strong>NOT ALLOWED</strong> to enter this safe space where all femmes and enbees under the LGBTQ+ rainbow umbrella are able to whine up on each other with no fear of harassment and bigotry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A sober club night centred around healing and inclusion for LGBTQBPOC members, Misery Party focuses on healing workshops, nail bars and a resident DJ for their sober and uplifting club nights. Misery invites the members of the community who don’t partake in drinking culture and are still trying to find their tribe. To come as you are even if you are struggling with your mental health, substance abuse, or are ultimately just quiet, sad and want to have a good time.  Misery is truly a communal space who work on decolonising and de-capitalising the club space whilst uplifting LGBTQBPOC in the meantime.  </p>
