<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Amid increasing gentrification affecting areas of East London, residents of Brick Lane risk having the same fate of their ancestors: leaving.</strong></em></p>



<p>Building, that&#8217;s what bricks are for. Since their invention, prior to 7500 BC, bricks have become a viable alternative in construction. But they have also gained a poignant meaning in history that is synonymous with peoples, families. Arrivals, departures, encounters. Because, with bricks, dwellings are built, bridges are erected, markets and community centres are created, roads are levelled, connecting and putting a place on the map, giving it life, presence, relevance.</p>



<p>On Brick Lane, and in the areas of Spitalfields and Tower Hamlets in East London, bricks have become the idiosyncratic allegory of centuries of traditions, communities. Growth, blended with stability. A stability achieved through inclusivity, acceptance, and a flow of transformations that, in the course of its existence, marked it to the point of becoming a crossroads open to all and in the heart of everyone.</p>



<p>“I have always been here,” said Rahad Miah, who works at the popular Bengal Village, while listening to traditional Bengali music in the background. “I was used to coming when I was a kid and I am still here.”</p>

<p>A field path in the countryside outside the City of London in 1500s, the street welcomed early Flemish settlers, whose brick kilns gave it its characteristic name. But it was not until the second half of 17<sup>th</sup> century, when other roads were laid out, that the area started developing and taking its modern, urban appearance.</p>



<p>Among other buildings, breweries popped up prosperously. The largest site, extended over the centuries, was bought by Joseph Truman in 1676 and kept actively producing beer until the end of 1990s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-965" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg 1516w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The Old Truman Brewery. Photo by Simone Pellegrino.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Currently owned by the Zeloof partnership, the complex has been used by small independent businesses as well as grassroots creative and cultural organisations. </p>



<p>In September 2021, the latest chapter of a long story of mutations began. A local committee approved <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://democracy.towerhamlets.gov.uk/documents/s190863/Appendix%201%20-%20PA2000415%20-%20DC%20Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">plans</a> for a 5-story development that would replace part of the Old Truman brewery with offices and brand-name chain shops.</p>



<p>For years, the area suffered corporate developments spreading from the richer City of London. This affected local communities with rising living costs and consequent displacement, as if the place their ancestors created took them back to their initial, mutual condition: leaving.</p>



<p>From 1680s onwards, a large community of Protestant Huguenots fleeing from persecutions in France moved to the area. Their textile skills and the fabrics brought from cities such as Nantes and Lyon enabled the district to emerge in weaving and garment making.</p>



<p>Their religion, which finally found relief in Huguenot Church on Brick Lane, co-existed with Anglicanism professed in the nearby Christ Church on Commercial Street.</p>



<p>These two faiths were joined first by the Jewish community of Ashkenazi and Yiddish-speaking Russian Jews sheltering from the wave of anti-Semitic pogroms in 19<sup>th</sup>&#8211; and 20<sup>th</sup>-century Eastern Europe and, more recently, by a large number of Muslim Bangladeshi Bengalis.</p>



<p>The latter, who left their land at the height of the war of independence from Pakistan, would work in the thriving local tailoring industry or open some of the iconic curry restaurants that even led to informally call the area ‘Banglatown’.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, bricks would keep changing their face as time went by. They would take on the colour of the graffiti that would often cover them, the scent of the fumes that would reach them from the kitchens, the taste of a pint of beer brewed in the district and spilled on the ground.</p>



<p>“It changed a lot,” said Miah. “Many of Bengalis left the area, many restaurants closed and the choice is not that diversified anymore.”</p>



<p>According to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/204259709/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/204259709/Runnymede_CoDE_Ethnically_Diverse_High_Streets_Briefing.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted by Centre on The Dynamics of Ethnicity and Runnymede Trust to gauge the current state of Brick Lane and its ethnical diversity, 17 restaurants have closed since 2014, leaving only 22 eateries open.</p>



<p>Ironically, it is as if the action of building has also inherent its own contradiction. While it is true that bricks are employed to erect bridges, they are also used to raise walls, to establish watchtowers from which to flush out the enemy and, as in the case of Brick Lane, to feed the dangerous greed that might turn ‘building’ into the equivalent of ‘demolishing’.</p>

<p>Although the process, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://battleforbricklane.com/the-threat" data-type="URL" data-id="https://battleforbricklane.com/the-threat" target="_blank">deemed</a> soulless by critics, followed the more common paradigm of what is described as gentrification, it also jeopardised the particular urban character of the district, and caused the loss of meaningful places.</p>



<p>According to <a href="http://classonline.org.uk/docs/Pushed_to_the_Margins_Gentrification_report_v5.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://classonline.org.uk/docs/Pushed_to_the_Margins_Gentrification_report_v5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> conducted by Centre for Labour and Social Studies and Runnymede Trust, the borough of Tower Hamlets was among those which gentrified most between 2010 and 2014.</p>



<p>In Brick Lane, “there are common dynamics of gentrification in increasing profits by improving the building stock and upgrading their usage for higher-rank users,” said Dr Ryan Centner, who is Assistant Professor of Urban Geographies in the Department of Geography and Environment at LSE. “But its gentrification has been influenced by a form of <em>tourist-ification</em>, in turning the place into a touristic attraction.” </p>



<p>Prior to the pandemic, more than 18,500 pedestrians walked along the street on an average day, according to <a href="https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/News_events/2021/August-2021/Welcome-Back-Brick-Lane.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> provided by Tower Hamlets council, making it one of London&#8217;s main cultural destinations.</p>



<p>In a statement released in April 2021, Jason Zeloof, on behalf of the partnership, had denied that the site would be transformed into a shopping mall, and had declared that his association would offer 20% of space to independent stores.</p>



<p>If some wait for an uncertain future with hope, many other residents decry the institutional carelessness for their concerns over the plan, which were repeatedly raised through protests and campaigning on social media.</p>

<p>A shopping centre would let Brick Lane become a “much more congested place” and lose its unpretentious nature, said Rahad Miah.</p>



<p>Mahbuba Sultana, who works in her family business in the Upmarket space of the Old Truman Brewery, seemed to disagree. </p>



<p>“A shopping mall would help us see more faces,” she said. “It would be like Westfield, where people have everything in one place.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-740" width="610" height="457" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001.jpg 833w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001-300x225.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/thumbnail_image001-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>Mahbuba Sultana and her family kiosk in the Upmarket. Photo by Simone Pellegrino.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With living costs already sitting at record high levels, the new development would further revamp the population of the area.</p>



<p>“The mall inevitably would bring a change in the demographics of residents, more businesses, like premium brands, an increase in local jobs, and a surge in rent and prices that will likely be slightly higher than the average growth in London,” said Austin Walker, who is a Sales Negotiator for real estate services provider Savills.</p>



<p>While the project got approved, its progress will depend on the outcome of a judicial review that campaigners from the Save Brick Lane coalition, created to fight the threats of gentrification for the local community, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/planning/401-planning-news/49501-high-court-gives-permission-for-judicial-review-over-impact-of-development-on-diversity-and-character-of-brick-lane-area" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/planning/401-planning-news/49501-high-court-gives-permission-for-judicial-review-over-impact-of-development-on-diversity-and-character-of-brick-lane-area" target="_blank">have been granted</a> by the High Court.</p>



<p>The group even started a crowdfunding initiative on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-brick-lane/" target="_blank">CrowdJustice</a> to cover costly legal fees and sustain their action against Tower Hamlets council. At the time of writing, donations topped £10,000.</p>



<p>On top of the burden that gentrification put on local residents and businesses, the backlash of Brexit might be the finishing blow. Curry houses were reportedly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/bangladeshi-caterers-association-calls-on-mps-to-throw-out-brexit-3612080" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/bangladeshi-caterers-association-calls-on-mps-to-throw-out-brexit-3612080" target="_blank">forced to close</a>, as visa rules were toughened amid a general clampdown on immigrants.</p>



<p>“Everything got expensive and it became very hard to survive,” said Forhad Ahmed, who manages an off-license on Brick Lane. “Brexit forgot the foreigners of this country.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/image00007.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-761" width="610" height="457" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/image00007.jpeg 1000w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/image00007-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/image00007-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>Forhad Ahmed in the off-license he manages.

<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><em><strong>If you will not let us into your spaces, we will create our own.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>LGBTQ+ and Ethnic communities struggle to find places where they feel welcome and can party and drink without the fear of being &#8216;othered&#8217; and alienated because of who they are and how they present. It is rare to find spaces that are controlled and populated by members of the LGBTQBIPOC community. Even the clubs that solely exist for the LGBTQ+ communities end up infiltrated and demonised by white cis-hetro fragile men. Or they exclude BIPOC members of the community. So to piss them off more, here is a list of the top 5 LGBTQBIPOC friendly clubs for the community and they actually have good music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>From being only open once a month to now a fully venue house party located under the Vauxhall arches, LICK is now notorious amongst the femme and non-binary club goers.

<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Since the beginning of Decentralized (DeFi) cryptocurrency in 2009, with the creation of Bitcoin, the ‘crypto-verse’ has taken the online world by storm. Despite financial institutions, such as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk" target="_blank">Bank of England</a>, warning investors to be prepared to lose all their money, it is estimated that around <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCtYOYhOf2AhVRZcAKHa7nBMQQFnoECAUQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcybercrew.uk%2Fblog%2Fcryptocurrency-statistics-uk%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gk1YE58ULO1DfsuKyGhn_" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCtYOYhOf2AhVRZcAKHa7nBMQQFnoECAUQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcybercrew.uk%2Fblog%2Fcryptocurrency-statistics-uk%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gk1YE58ULO1DfsuKyGhn_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.8 million</a> people in the U.K. hold some sort of Cryptocurrency as of February 2021.</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Alongside the rise in interest towards NFT’s (Non-fungible token), even those who don’t invest in cryptocurrency have heard all about it, and the possible rewards that come with investing. From social media trends surrounding ‘<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dogecoin.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dogecoin.com" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a>’ to headlines from an ex-McDonald’s worker to a crypto millionaire, cryptocurrency has certainly gained a lot of interest, especially among younger generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Definitely invest,” said <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/itsnowkone/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/itsnowkone/" target="_blank">Kone Oumar</a>, a 19-year-old cryptocurrency investor. Despite his initial fears of “losing money and investing in bad projects”, he said that investing into cryptocurrency has made him “more financially stable and more aware of how he spends his money”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially being introduced to cryptocurrency back in 2014 and looking it up online he “wasn’t really interested”. However, after the upward trend in cryptocurrency being seen as a get-rich-quick scheme, Kone decided to invest. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Introduced after the 2008 financial crash many consider cryptocurrency to be a “true innovation on money,” such as David, a representative for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://titano.finance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://titano.finance/" target="_blank">Titano Finance</a> and the Titano community.  “Cryptocurrency is an industry that utilises a particular type of technology to create value.  Money gets its value by all of us agreeing that something is worth something”.  </p>

<p>Titano is a ‘DeFi’ token that launched in November 2021 and is the first of its kind, making use of its ‘Titano Autostaking Protocol’ (TAP) makes “staking easier and gives TITANO token holders the highest stable returns in crypto” via rebase rewards.</p>



<p>People “want to claim their full value from the financial system,” said David. “We’ve been so used to settling for what we have, and we live in a society that believes in the scarcity principle: if I have it, you can’t have it, so I gotta keep it from you,&#8221; a principle cryptocurrency offers a way out from.</p>



<p>According to Titano, their coin “provides platforms, tools and guidance so each of our investors and partners can learn and participate and profit from it”, proving the &#8216;crypto-verse&#8217; to possibly not be as volatile as one would believe and friendlier for the new investors. </p>



<p>With many young people finding cryptocurrency hard to navigate, “we need more creators willing to create straight forward introductions into the scene&#8221;,  which is why auto-staking or rebase tokens such as Titano’s make investing in cryptocurrency easy, taking by “the learning curve down to zero.&#8221;</p>

<p>Titano is a community-run rebase token. This means that “the supply of the token is increased or decreased algorithmically, based on the current price of each token”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Titano makes use of this formula to “increase the token supply, allowing  Titano holders to keep growing their tokens” and therefore, making profit from the money they put into the coin. “It’s a grand experiment. I want to give power to the people,” said David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency can often feel like a gamble. “The scammers are very motivated, very smart and come up with ways that you know, you just thought you had no idea was possible,” said David. Titano team members, like many other cryptocurrency teams, remain anonymous, which can often deter many from investing. However, he thinks that anonymity provides a sense of security, not only to the team members but to users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked why the Titano team remain anonymous despite fears held by investors, he said that doxing “is typically done so you can verify who it is that you are dealing with. There is much better ways to protect yourself than having someone’s name or ‘linkedin’ which could also be faked.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Come in and spend some time, get to know the space. See if you like it. Ask the tough questions. Do your research. Read the <a href="https://docs.titano.finance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://docs.titano.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">white paper</a>, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzp4XQqxucZ-R7TgT-Ug3pg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzp4XQqxucZ-R7TgT-Ug3pg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMA’s</a> and see what we do,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sean Edwards, a 20-year-old Titano investor, first started investing in cryptocurrency in March 2021. He was inspired by “the incentive to make amounts of money that would have taken me years to make using traditional methods,<strong>”</strong> adding that “better APR rates” makes cryptocurrency more appealing than mainstream banking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He stated that cryptocurrency is totally worth it but “only if you’re willing to do your own research and accept that you don’t know it all”. Going on to add that you shouldn’t “invest more than you’re willing to lose.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Like David, Edwards believes that the anonymity associated with the &#8216;DeFi&#8217; side of cryptocurrency is a positive. “I like that I&#8217;m able to invest privately. We want to be our own banks; we want financial freedom.&#8221;</p>



<p>To those unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, this may sound, as Edwards says, “naïve and dangerously optimistic,” but he feels this proves that we have “been conditioned into thinking that we can’t achieve our financial dreams. This is what crypto aims to change.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although cryptocurrency is decentralised, there is a sense of community found among investors, which has allowed projects within the cryptocurrency universe to thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community members helping one another get involved into cryptocurrency. “Through interacting with people in the Telegram groups and on discord, there is a sense of a common goal to build something unique in the DeFi space,” said Edwards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point in time, cryptocurrency is still considered to be a gamble. A lot more research needs to be done. But the future importance of cryptocurrency is becoming clearer as the technology develops. With Bitcoin now being a legal tender, cryptocurrency is now becoming more relevant than ever. With talks of cryptocurrency soon becoming a way of paying for everyday items and a new way to break away from the 9-5 life, we should give cryptocurrency more of a thought.&nbsp;</p>
