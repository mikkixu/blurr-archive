<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>In a recent short film, sta</strong></em><strong><em>rlings help a lonely elderly man find his way back to the experience of the world around.</em> </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">It is silence that opens the short film <em>Starlings</em>, directed by Simon Allen. But despite the dullness of muffled noises suffocated in the background, it speaks loudly, in a captivating fashion. And it does, for the protagonist of this story has to respond to two types of deafness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The first is a physical impairment that requires him to wear a hearing aid to retrieve his ability to detect sounds, while the second is a form of social isolation, perhaps fed by the awareness that the device allows him to get back, which keeps him out of a world that he does not feel connected to anymore.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-466" width="610" height="316" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/hearing-aid.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption>The man wears a hearing aid. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I wanted to explore the concept of loneliness,” said Alexandra Prew, who wrote the script of the film. “I was really interested in a silent film with no dialogues, which I knew was going to be a challenge.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The picture, presented in-person for the first time at the London Short Film Festival last January, was selected along with six other international submissions as part of <em>Anthropocene’s Deities</em>. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.shortfilms.org.uk/events/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.shortfilms.org.uk/events/22-01-22-anthropocene%27s-deities" target="_blank">event</a>, held at the Institute of Contemporary Art, aimed at digging into and contemplating the richness and fragility of ecosystems, where several, divergent beings run into the other and interact.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The single human character, played by Bedfordshire actor Carl Welch, is an elderly man whose name remains unknown almost to avoid any specification that could limit the narrative to only one person. He spends the days growing plants in his garden and, as if these were mirrors of his solitary existence, shielding them from the attacks of starlings that land on the allotment and eat produce.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“The movie captures the loneliness of capitalist societies in our disconnection from nature,” said Emma Bouraba, who curated the programme and took part in the pre-selection of films to be later shortlisted for this year’s edition of the Festival. “It shows the fight we have against the ecology we are a part of.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Starlings turn out to be the ultimate species to convey this message. They act as intruders that invade and hinder the cynical, self-centred and isolated life cycle of the man and his vines, which reject any experience of concurrence and seek their expulsion.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I got googling starlings and I was like, wait, everyone hates these birds,” said Prew. “They are huge pests: a big problem for agriculture and farming.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">According to <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/reports/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/reports/Wildlife%20Damage%20Management%20Technical%20Series/European-Starlings-WDM-Technical-Series.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>, European starlings are often the reason of damages to apples, blue berries, cherries, figs and grapes, as they either cause direct losses from eating fruits or reduce product quality by pecking and slashing at them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The ecology portrayed in the film is analogous. Human conventions are unearthed and relentlessly confronted with the perseverance of the birds that, despite the manifold attempts set out by the man to send them away, carry on returning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">An anti-bird netting, stifling and tightening around the plants, as if to put an end to the growth that would bring them into a direct discovery of their surroundings; ultrasonic repellents to annoy the birds and even the classic scarecrow, made from scraps, cuttings, leftover buttons, that the protagonist tries and make abnormal and intimidating in accordance with human perception, which is accustomed to creating and loathing what is Other. All efforts would fail in their intent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-467" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/scarecrow.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>All attempts to remove birds prove ineffective. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The dread of the unnaturalness would only be conceived by the man and rather overlooked by the still innocent, uncorrupted birds. Nonetheless, the solution would be meanly found by killing one of them, ultimately eliminating what is seen as unwelcome and further isolating from the experience of social contact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-470" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1024x531.png 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-300x156.png 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-768x398.png 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead-1200x623.png 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/starling-dead.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The man kills one of the birds in his garden. From <em>Starlings</em>, 2021.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Shot during the second wave of harder restrictions imposed in the U.K. to quell the spread of the coronavirus, the short film was able to touch on the question of loneliness as people were increasingly becoming familiar with it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I wrote the script before lockdown happened and before we even knew anything about Covid-19,” said Prew. “Then the subject matter became even more prevalent.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">According to a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain/3aprilto3may2020#who-is-feeling-lonely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a> published by the Office for National Statistics in 2020, the equivalent of 7.4 million people said that their well-being was affected through feeling lonely during the first month of lockdown. In particular, research found that those aged 16 to 24 were more likely to have experienced loneliness due to Covid-19 tough regulations, namely 50.8% of respondents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">A previous <a href="https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/basw_94738-5_0.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.basw.co.uk/system/files/resources/basw_94738-5_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> that had looked into the impact of loneliness in similar age groups in 2017, published by U.K. charity Action for Children and the MP Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, had found that 43% of young people had undergone through such feelings even prior to the pandemic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The actual number of teenagers and young adults suffering from this condition might even be higher, as loneliness often trivially conceals among people who experience it despite the fact they are not necessarily alone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Loneliness is a subjective feeling that arises when one feels that there is a gap between their desired and actual social contacts,” said Sam Fardghassemi, who is teaching fellow in the Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology at UCL and has conducted in-depth work to analyse the issue in young people of London.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Due to this ambivalence, loneliness differs from social isolation. This circumstance, in which the man is presented in the first half of the film, can be described as the objective, partial reduction or total exclusion of other social contacts from one person’s daily life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Japan has often been associated with the issue. In the country, young adults who are socially reclused are estimated to have topped 500,000 and different nuances of withdrawal have been found over time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><em>Sotokomori</em> (Japanese for withdrawn, outside) refers to people whose outings are only limited to pursuing their interests, their agenda, or fulfilling practical needs such as food shopping. A more acute type of isolation concerns <em>hikikomori</em> (Japanese for withdrawn, inside), who are known to totally cut themselves off from the external world.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The latter state is emphasised in the man’s purchase of ultrasonic repellents to try and get rid of the birds, that he makes online, without leaving home and confining in a comfort zone he has built, whereby nothing else can meddle.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“It is as if they continue to exist as a being while being socially dead, and passively observing outside activities,” said Dr Maki Rooksby of the Institute of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Glasgow, whose expertise also covers social isolation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Discovered in the mid-1980s as a socio-cultural phenomenon by Japanese psychiatrist Tamaki Saito, who would later coin the term, hikikomori only seemed to belong to Japan.</p>

</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“I had not come across anything the same as hikikomori, as a recognised, semi-widespread, identifiable social phenomenon in the UK,” said Professor Robert MacDonald, who is co-Editor in Chief of Journal of Youth Studies, referring to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.the-sarf.org.uk/the-new-british-hikikomori/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.the-sarf.org.uk/the-new-british-hikikomori/" target="_blank">piece</a> he had written in 2015 about the existence of British hikikomori.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">More recently, things might have changed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Although we don&#8217;t know very much whether some countries are more vulnerable to it and how, we know it is a global mental health issue today, with cases reported throughout the world,” said Dr Rooksby.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Identifying, gauging and understanding the issue allows us to figure out the most appropriate solutions to let patients get back to appreciating the beauty of discovery and contact with what is around.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Effective treatment approaches include those where clinicians tune in with the withdrawn person and share the journey of exploring interests or activities that may help them find meaning in their lives,” said Dr Rooksby.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">In the case of the protagonist, the journey will be the pictorial flight of starlings shown in a documentary on television, where the birds dance and shape cinematic images in the sky in a rigorous-yet-liberating synchronised hymn to community and interaction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The murmuration will work as a glimpse of the world that he has missed and still might miss; a glimpse of the complex system of our contemporary societies in which the role of each component is critical but always dependant on the acknowledgement of the Other.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">It will work as a positive change of the man’s mind, a mighty driving force that will get him out of his armchair, out of his house to buy food dispensers that would feed those birds that, he now knows, are worth welcoming. </p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Curator Karen Serres reflects on the role that portraiture plays in defining the post-Impressionist painter.</strong></em></p>



<p>There is something uncanny in the hands of a painter. Something that flows through their fingers and reaches the end of the brush, leaving a trace on the canvas. A connection that unveils what is in fact behind a hasty stroke, and conveys the signs of an artist’s time and space. Now, imagine you slightly move back, open your eyes wide and realise that their fingers, their hands, along with the rest of their body, can be viewed. This is the magic of self-portraits.</p>



<p>In the case of post-Impressionist master Vincent van Gogh, 16 of such works are displayed in an unmissable exhibition at The Courtauld Gallery until 8 May. </p>



<p>The time spans from 1886 to 1889. In four years, his technique, his colours and his clothes would change. But, most interestingly, he himself would change. As if, underlying one of the prominent names in Western art history, there were more identities, more personas all converging into this versatile painter’s space. </p>



<p>To fully understand the nuances of van Gogh, I spoke to Dr Karen Serres, Curator of Paintings at The Courtauld Gallery and more recently, curator of the exhibition.</p>



<p><strong><em>Hi, Karen. I had the chance to visit the exhibition you and your team worked on. Was it challenging to set it up?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, is the short answer, but not for the reasons that one would expect. There is always so many van Gogh exhibitions in the world and we wanted to do an exhibition that was different. We always knew that it was going to be something around the self-portrait of the bandaged ear, which is in our collection, but we didn&#8217;t know which direction to take it in.</p>

<p><strong><em>What have you done?</em></strong></p>



<p>We started looking at other self-portraits exhibitions. We were surprised that there hadn&#8217;t been one in the past, but that is because these works are so in demand, that it is just really difficult to get them all at the same time in the same place. We sent out our first loan letter seven years ago. All of the loans that we asked for were agreed, but the real challenge was finding the right date, then further complicated by the pandemic.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why did you choose to focus on self-portraiture?</em></strong></p>



<p>For van Gogh, there is a notion of just your own features being very familiar. They are ever shifting, but they are also very intimate. It is something very captivating to return to over time because you notice new things, you represent new things.</p>



<p><strong><em>What was your goal?</em></strong></p>



<p>We only have two rooms at The Courtauld and we really wanted the exhibition to move away from the myth of the tortured genius while being very focused, so as to let people leave having enjoyed the works but also having learned something and actually changed or perhaps challenged the way you think about some of his works.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think you succeeded?</em></strong></p>



<p>It was easy for a van Gogh exhibition to be very blockbuster-y as it is such a famous name, but I think it actually shows the evolution of his style and life through one single motif; it makes it more complicated. You can really take time and look at each work one by one, and then you&#8217;re also able to make relationships.</p>

<p><strong><em>The idea you have when you are in the rooms is that van Gogh was many things at once. How many alter egos can visitors spot in the exhibition?</em></strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>It is subjective, but a lot of his persona is really wrapped up and projected into those works. It is only when you look around that you have all these people looking at you, that there is a physical relationship which is very important. I think one identity is definitely the more traditional Parisian, bourgeois man that you do not know what his profession is. He is really just well-dressed and often with a felt hat.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Then you have his identity as a painter, when he&#8217;s wearing the blue smock and the straw hat. Later on, he employs self-portraiture when he is recovering from some kind of crisis. There, you really feel that there is much more charge and you can tell that he is almost using this as a lifeboat.</p>

<p><strong><em>If we compare van Gogh to other artists who used self-portraiture, do you think we would discover a similar application of this technique?</em></strong></p>



<p>There was an exhibition a few years ago at the Royal Academy by a Finnish artist called Helene Schjerfbeck who would illustrate her old age truthfully, in a very stark way. Previously, other artists like Gustave Courbet and Paul Gauguin had played much more with their identity. Some of them dressed up, sometimes they changed their periods or wore other clothing and they did that on purpose to unsettle the viewer.</p>



<p><strong><em>How does van Gogh differ?</em></strong></p>



<p>There is no faking in him and everything feels very honest. Moreover, I think what is unique about him is the timescale. He evolved so much during his time in Paris, and then just as he was finding this recognisable and very powerful style, his mental health crisis happened. It is thought-provoking to see these compressed moments work together or against each other.</p>

<p><strong><em>Even colours tend to change over time. What can this transformation tell us about van Gogh as an artist and as a human being?</em></strong></p>



<p>What is most fascinating, and that is also why we wrote down the months, is actually how quickly this happens. You can see this evolution almost from month to month. He goes from the darker colours that he took from Rembrandt and then as soon as he knows more, and looks at more works by the Impressionists, he definitely adopts their much lighter colours. And then as he evolves over those four years, he uses these very bold pure colours like pure orange or pure blue. This is a progression that you see in his other works as well, but it&#8217;s obviously not as easy to see because the motifs are different.</p>



<p><strong><em>In the second room visitors can also find <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-van-goghs-chair" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-van-goghs-chair" target="_blank">van Gogh’s chair</a> and his portrait of the Belgian painter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" target="_blank">Eugène Boch</a>, respectively from collections at the National Gallery and Musée d&#8217;Orsay, as if these paintings contributed to the overall idea of his identity. Why did you include them?</em></strong> </p>



<p>We wanted to slightly push the notion of self-representation a bit beyond, just having his self-portraits to make people think a little bit more and indeed to be able to compare how he represented himself and how he represented other people and things as well. We had a very long debate about Eugene Boch’s portrait.</p>



<p><strong><em>Did you disagree?</em></strong></p>



<p>Even during the time, people said that Boch and van Gogh looked alike. They had the same slightly angular features, the same little beard and the dark blonde hair. We were worried that people were going to think actually that it that it was van Gogh and it was going to get complicated.&nbsp; Yet one of the reasons why he did some portraits, he says, was as an exercise to become a really good portrait painter of other people. As he wrote about this person being an ideal artist, we felt that there was so much of his own projection into this work that we wanted to include it but to be honest we were not 100% sure how it was going to work.</p>



<p><strong><em>What can you tell me about the background of this work?</em></strong></p>



<p>The backgrounds in his own self-portraits are very vague, abstract. They don&#8217;t represent anything and the only one that actually depicts something is The Courtauld’s self-portrait with bandaged ear where you can actually have a recognisable backdrop. What is gripping in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/eugène-boch/XgGNl2sJR4Q63Q?hl=en" target="_blank">Boch</a>’s is that it is not only recognisable, but also imaginary. This starry sky is a really nice comparison between a real kind of identifiable background and then a dreamy scene that is so important for van Gogh.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think the choice of self-portraiture contributed to the success of this exhibition?</em></strong></p>



<p>I think self-portraiture has taken a new residence for people. Several people have commented that it you look at self-portraits differently after the pandemic. Maybe we now have a different relationship to it, as before there was a notion that if an artist was making a self-portrait, they were being very vain or narcissistic. I hope now that, looking at this exploration of our features, it is a little bit more nuanced in our minds and there is a moving aspect to it.</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><em>The new phenomena of hook-ups being available at the swipe of a finger has left it more difficult than ever to find a meaningful relationship.</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-538" width="610" height="381" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited.jpg 2400w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-300x188.jpg 300w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-768x480.jpg 768w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-2048x1280.jpg 2048w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-1600x1000.jpg 1600w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-1200x750.jpg 1200w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/KISS-2-edited-1980x1238.jpg 1980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption><br>Image provided by Unsplash</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The popular dating app Tinder was founded by Sean Rad in 2012. By 2014, it had an estimated one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/fashion/tinder-the-fast-growing-dating-app-taps-an-age-old-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billion</a> daily swipes. This was just the beginning of a huge cultural shift towards a digital age of dating. A world of swiping and matching was quickly born; one fuelled by a reliance on instant gratification and the chance of a quick shag, simply by clicking a few buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the invention of Tinder, many cunning entrepreneurs followed suit, eyeing up the opportunity to capitalise of us singletons’ quest for love, and an array of other dating apps were created: Hinge, Bumble, Grindr, and Thursday to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although genuine relationships have been found through dating apps, they have also become a site of disappointment, where hook-up culture is normalised. Whilst the de-stigmatisation of casual sex and pleasure undeniably has its positives, research suggests that online dating could be negatively affecting our experiences of love, sex, and intimacy, as physcotherapist Andrea Freira<em> </em>explains how and why our emotional needs might not be being met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s Friday night and I’m getting ready for a date with a guy I’ve matched on Hinge. He looked perfectly normal. Attractive. Nice eyes and smile. Good dress sense. His profile had the right ratio of selfies and pictures with friends and family, confirming he wasn’t a serial killer. We chatted for a couple of days and seemed to have a lot in common, so decided to go to the pub.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now six pints, a hangover, and a ghost later, I’m wondering where it all went wrong. If you’re fortunate enough to not know what ghosting is, the urban dictionary coins it as, “a person cutting off all communication with zero warning.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That week, the front room of my shared house was host to many feminist chats, with me the angry ringleader. I was consoled by the girls that of course, this was his loss; that there was nothing wrong with me. However, it wasn’t insecurity or fear of rejection that was niggling at me. I was genuinely confused by the online dating world and the lies that seemed to accompany it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a newly single person, I was totally unfamiliar with the convoluted subtext that came with dating. “I’d love to take you on another date” seems to translate as “You will literally never hear from me again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I’m not the only one. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/" target="_blank">study</a> directed by the Pew Research Centre found that 45% of online daters were left feeling frustrated by the experience, compared with a mere 28% that felt hopeful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Could we, Gen Z, be quite literally fucked?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are the generation that have grown up with an endless pool of options, in all aspects of life. Netflix presents us with a dizzying array of entertainment, where the maximum effort required is moving your fingers to remote. To accompany our movie night, we click a few buttons, and a McDonalds magically appears at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="697" height="392" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-525" srcset="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3.jpg 697w, https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/tinder-edited-3-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><figcaption>Popular dating app, Tinder. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The notion of minimum input, maximum output, has unfortunately trickled into our love lives. As 19-year-old Tinder-user <em>Honor Newman</em> explains: “One of the issues with dating apps is that it’s so easy to find somebody. You don’t have to put it any effort. It’s not a chase, it’s just there you go.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The art of communication is being lost in translation. When singles enter the online dating world and meet their match, there is no blueprint stating how serious a connection that person is looking for. (Unless of course, they write it on their profile, which is a rarity.) “I think more men use Tinder for a quick shag, to just have sex with lots of different people really easily,” says Newman. “Women aren’t necessarily just looking for sex, we actually want to find somebody.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When two people are online dating with different intentions and not communicating, problems can arise. Communication issues can of course also occur in same-sex relationships, but psycho-therapist Andrea Freira explains the part gender roles play when it comes to heterosexual dating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The male and female brains are wired differently, so biologically speaking we are different, women are a lot more attuned with their emotional side. Men often go into dating with less expectations and that’s sometimes where the conflict occurs, as men are perhaps just looking to get to know you and are typically a lot harder to get to commit to a relationship than women are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a vast majority of men are using these apps just to find different sexual partners, it’s no wonder emotional connections and meaningful relationships are not being found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that occurs when using dating apps is the immense build-up. Often, when you match with someone online, you start to create an idea of that person in your head, creating a false narrative of what you think they’re like – or, what you want them to be like. This is where meeting a potential partner in person, as opposed to on a dating app, could be more beneficial. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you are meeting someone in real life you can use your intuition to guide you, whereas when you are engaging or getting to know someone online there is always an expectation,” Freira explains. “Usually, people go into online dating with an outcome in their mind. Whereas as if you were able to go into it just looking to know that person and experience that person, without any expectation of an outcome it could be a lot more fulfilling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, perhaps it’s not all doom and gloom. Perhaps it’s about actively changing our mindsets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>There is </strong><strong>still </strong><strong>hope.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the many of us still single and exasperated online-daters, there are a notable number of couples whose modern love-stories began at the swipe of a finger. According to The Future of Dating <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eharmony.co.uk/dating-advice/dating/the-future-of-dating-report-2018-smart-devices-to-predict-if-your-relationship-is-on-the-rocks/" target="_blank">report</a> by The Imperial College Business School and eHarmony, 32% of relationships that started between 2015 and 2019 met online, and by 2035 they estimate that more than 50% of couples will have met through online dating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is 21-year-old *Katie Thomas* who met her now boyfriend on Hinge. After over a year on the app with no luck and a string of unsuccessful matches, she explains how this time was different.&nbsp; &#8220;He made it clear from the get-go what he wanted. There was no messing around, there was no game playing,&#8221; she says. Communication was key from the offset. “There was consistent effort on his part, which gave me the space to also put effort in and be honest without feeling silly or feeling like it wasn’t going to go anywhere.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer could be in the way we approach online-dating and the kind of communication we use. As Freira says, “It can work if two people can go into it with the right mindset and allow things to develop and really enjoy getting to know the other person. Go into it with an open mind and don’t attach yourselves to any potential outcome. Just allow it to just flow.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making a conscious effort to have no pre-conceptions about your match while being communicative and honest from the beginning, could be key in using dating apps to your full advantage, and not hurting anyone else in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><em>As the pandemic reshaped our conception of love and relationships, the words of American author bell hooks are more prevalent than ever. </em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-primary-color has-text-color">As I sit down at my dining table a week from spending another Valentine’s alone, listening to the gospel of Eric Clapton, I can’t help but wonder: was bell hooks right? Is young culture today cynical about love? Are we really creating a culture of 20 something un-romantics who can name the strangest of kinks, but cringe at the thought of love?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2000, the book <em>All About Love: New Visions</em> had explored love in modern society. Twenty-two years later, amid post-covid and digital love youth,&nbsp;the&nbsp;work remains current. GenZers&nbsp;have found a false sense of comfort in a culture of hook-ups, instant gratification, cynicism and isolation. Was bell hooks right, are we too cynical to truly love?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being young is hard. In the face of a looming climate crisis, flop governments and post-covid anxiety, it is not a surprise that love is tough to find. Young people are letting go of the quest for love and intimacy, as bell hooks says ahead of her time: cynicism is the great mask of the disappointed and betrayed heart. </p>



<p>We are a generation whose connection to love has been warped by hook-up culture, sex-orientated TV shows, dating app companies which thrive on loneliness and two whole years of almost pure isolation. So, I joined&nbsp;a group of GenZers, Tristan (19), Tasia (19), Karis (20) and Kiera (19), who were ready to explore their own ideas and connection to loving whilst young. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Five young individuals gathered with two bottles of wine between us wondering and delving into the effects of being without love. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“<strong>That shit [love] is gone, there is nowhere to meet people organically, everyone is just trying to fuck,” said Tristan.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It’s a lonely world out there for GenZers, especially those who don’t partake in hook-up culture. Even non-romantic love is a struggle, with social media becoming our ever-present judge on our image, education and careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are more focused on how we stand in a capitalist world than building communities and long-lasting relationships. “It’s not just romantic love that is lost, it’s also self-love. Everyone is too cynical,” says 20-year-old Karis, “Social media and growing cynicism is not only damaging our love lives, but also the love that we have for ourselves.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most young people aren’t even comfortable speaking about love. It is easier to get young people to speak about favourite sex positions than to get them to tell their friends ‘I love you.’ &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can speak about love but only in my inner circles,” says Tristan, who easily told me about his&nbsp;sexual encounters, but stuttered when trying to define love. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a generation that is studious when it comes to sex positivity but emotionally stunted at the topic of love: it is no surprise that young people have essentially dropped out of the race for love. It requires commitment, longevity and truthfulness. But who could blame us , when social media companies have shaped dating into a swift finger motion of purely aestheticism and desirability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is it even possible to commit when you are just a three second image on a person’s smart phone? Instant gratification over long-term commitment defines our generation. Food deliveries instead of cooking, next-day shipping and seven-second TikTok videos. All life changing conveniences: the prize of the modern world, a double-edged sword that corrupts our attention spans and willingness to commit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every one of my interviewees were on dating apps. Their faces looked disappointed when I asked the dreaded question, which we all know well, ‘Have you found someone?’&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kiera, the only one who has been in a relationship (for 4 and a half years,) described them as ‘a chore.’&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t feel like love is lost amongst young people, deep down it is what majority of us want,” she said with such hopefulness that maybe only someone in a loving relationship could conceive. Her and her boyfriend were high-school sweethearts, their&nbsp;love was organic, and their brains still uncorrupted by the anti-love tech giants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there, it can be possible for young people to commit to love. Kiera’s testimony gives us a momentary glimmer into the idea of love still existing in our culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then comes Covid-19, two years of isolation and complete digital submergence, it feels like if any of us had hope for putting ourselves out there, it was all out of the window. Isolation physically stopped us from interacting and making long-term intimate connections. </p>



<p>“Quarantine made me feel more comfortable with the idea of being by myself,” says Tasia, as the energy of the group simmered down as the wine was reaching an end. “It doesn’t seem like there is any time to build a whole new intimate relationship” and&nbsp;the idea of committing to a new relationship, as the world around you is reaching Armageddon, seems like a prison sentence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Life feels like it’s slipping fast. According to Tristan, “Relationships seem like they always have an inevitable ending”. In a post-pandemic world where we were cruelly shown that we have no control over our lives, young people want stability and comfort in things that aren’t as big of a gamble as relationships seem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To love or not to love, that is the question. There are many ways of looking at it. bell hooks tells us to love, as a generous heart is always open. American actress&nbsp;Jenny Slate says she would rather live with a tender heart, for it is the key to finding love. Eric Clapton sings “You just don’t realise how much I love you”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Love and loving are natural to human existence. The very first thing we do as we enter the world is love, as we are held by our mothers and see their loving eyes for the first time, all the way until we lay on our death bed and have the loves of our lives flash before our eyes as the very last thing we do. As young people we shouldn’t lose all hope on finding love. As the leaders of the world to come, building our communities on all things encompassing love should be a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Queer inclusion in film has been a minefield since the early inception of the medium. Industry guidelines such as Hollywood’s Hays Code as well as censorship laws across different nations, have made Queer stories a complete commercial risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Queer film dates back to around the late 1800s with “The Dickson Experimental Sound Film”, released in 1894, often referenced as the first &#8220;queer” motion-picture project due to its portrayal of two men sharing a dance together. Not long afterwards, the likes of Chaplin used a variety of queer comedy gags across a few different productions. other films featured lesser or more explicit queer illustrations, but this quickly diminished in the 1930s. Many nations began enforcing what can be described as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_LGBT_issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“no homo promo”</a> laws to different extremities claiming it was a matter of ethics and Hollywood followed suit when they saw the inception of the Motion Picture Production Code which prohibited a list of obscenities being shown in productions. One of these was any portrayal of homosexuality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the restrictions on promoting homosexuality in film were enforced, screenwriters had to find crafty ways to include queer characters in their creations. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sonyclassics.com/celluloid/misc/history.htmlhttps://www.sonyclassics.com/celluloid/misc/history.html" target="_blank">The Celluloid Closet</a> states that “For all its efforts, the Production Code didn&#8217;t erase homosexuals from the screen; it just made them harder to find. And now they had a new identity, as cold-blooded villains”. We can see this play out in Joel Cairo, the antagonist in The Maltese Falcon who is distinguished through his effeminate conduct and apparent love of perfume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving into the 1950s and 60s the film landscape saw occasional mentions of queerness such as Rebel Without a Cause, a film that is referenced as featuring the first gay teenager, and Victim, a film that criticised the rampant homophobia in Britain at the time. It wasn’t until the end of the 60s that the Hays Code was finally lifted. As social attitudes slowly became more progressive, the queer character could attempt to move into the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 70s and 80s saw an increase in representation both explicitly and implicitly. Films like Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence featured displays of queer attraction without offering itself as an exclusively queer creation. Other directors like John Waters – who created the cult film Pink Flamingos, an experimental and inescapably queer film – challenged norms and the definitive idea of camp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 1990s is where everything truly took off. Tensions around the HIV/AIDS epidemic were high, as wider society questioned the morality of the increasing numbers of LGBT movements, particularly those involving the youth. This created a two-way split when it came to the mainstream inclusion of queer characters, they were either the victim or the perpetrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The queer villain was no longer merely just a flamboyant stereotype, but instead a heartless pervert. Films like Cruising, the story of a detective searching for a serial killer who was involved with the gay BDSM community presented homosexuals as solely sex-crazed lunatics, a stereotype that while having no evident basis, still finds its way into portrayal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, many films developed a somewhat-problematic feeling of sympathy from the viewers perspective such as in Boys Don’t Cry, in which a transgender young adult suffers various hate-crimes once their biological sex is discovered. While examples of this are not inherently problematic by themselves, the development and the normalisation of this type of plotline are up for question about whether they spread openness or instead portray the homosexual as something to pity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The New Queer Cinema movement of the 90s led by directors such as Gregg Araki fought the stigmas and stereotypes and led a generation of LGBT viewership towards a brighter hope into the new millennium. With many countries easing restrictions on LGBT cinema, queer characters are more prevalent than ever, but does this lead to a new problem: commodification?&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the matter of historical queer representation in cinema, Caspar Salmon, a film critic who specialises in LGBT and arthouse cinema, believes that the queer villain trope has been damaging. It has played on a massively hateful and discriminatory trope, namely that queer people living among ‘normal’ people in society represented something to be feared. The idea of queer villainy played on pre-existing fears and must have reinforced damaging prejudices, while keeping homosexuals from being seen in more positive light.”&nbsp; Despite the damage these tropes may have caused, Salmon feels that queer people have always had a discerning eye: “Queer audiences have always been able to look at society from an angle, and some quite thrillingly reclaimed villainy as a positive, with many villains becoming camp icons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are we now commodifying queer characters? Salmon thinks so. “We see this most notably with Disney at the moment, where the idea of making such and such a character &#8220;gay&#8221; in order to appease certain audiences, comes at the expense of creating rich characters, and can be used as a prop to push the commercial machine forward”. Despite Disney claiming allyship their openly queer representation is truly sour. LGBT viewers struggle to candidly relate to something like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/disneys-8-first-openly-gay-characters-ranked-by-how-e-1847025396/slides/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toy Story 4’s background lesbian characters,</a> something which still managed to fuel a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/10/toy-story-4-blindsided-families-lesbian-scene-claims-anti-lgbtq-group-10148280/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative press campaign</a> despite being so insignificant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ll give you another example: the customised Netflix Twitter accounts that operate under the banner of minority rights. Netflix has several Twitter accounts &#8211; &#8220;Most&#8221; and &#8220;Strong and Black Lead&#8221; are the ones dealing with LGBTQ+ and Black/African-American content &#8211; which market Netflix content from the point of view of queer and Black representation. It seems inarguable to me that representation, in this case, has been successfully commodified by an enormous corporation”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The modern issue is no longer a lack of visibility, rather, two-dimensional characters that make you wonder if their existence in the script was merely marked by “token character #1”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The concept of this idealism evolving from once being a commercial risk into a product of corporate greed is not only incredibly warped but reinforces a sentiment that we need to support uniquely queer stories. We need smaller and indie queer creators in a landscape dominated by plastic imagery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In London alone, a multitude of organizations such as Fringe!, Queer East and BFI Flare all run film festivals dedicated to shedding light on independent queer audiovisual projects and aim to exemplify the unheard stories of the people who deserve the loudest voices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that queer characters have found their place in the mainstream there is a whole new battle to fight, one which ensures depth and true insight, instead of trivial empty shells.&nbsp;It may be an uphill battle but with an extended history of fighting for what&#8217;s right it seems that anything is possible.&nbsp;</p>

In turn, Batman’s relationship with Commissioner <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/james-gordon" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/james-gordon" target="_blank">James Gordon</a> becomes apparent, as well as the introduction to his own acquaintance with Catwoman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the audience trailed into a point of view cold open to the Riddler and his first murder, the movie already created a set-in-stone grungy, neo-noir tonality. This opening is then followed by the introduction to Batman via criminals being riddled by the fear of the shadows in a rainy dark Gotham. In turn, the audience has no other option but to feel like they are somehow committing a crime and that they should also fear the legend of the Batman themselves. This well-versed resonance feel with a comic book accurate depiction of Batman has already left the die-hard fans begging for more. His entry onto the screens following an intimidating metal clanking that could mock <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob_Marley" data-type="URL" data-id="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob_Marley" target="_blank">Marley’s</a> chains in &#8216;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol" target="_blank">A Christmas Carol</a>&#8216;, leaves us presented with our first look at the suited-up Robert Pattison’s Batman. Which of course many people have different opinions on, but of course paved the way for some amazing cinematic shots.</p>

<p>Throughout the almost 3-hour action film, we then follow this vengeance-seeking, angry, not-one to pull his punches Batman who in his own right remains angry at the corruption ruining Gotham- the same corruption that killed his parents. Matt Reeves deviated from showing the obvious popular storyline of Bruce Wayne’s parents dying and instead focuses primarily on the mental states and thought processes of Bruce Wayne and Batman, a point of view never focused on so greatly before, giving way to a whole new psychological depiction of Batman and Bruce Wayne. </p>



<p>A depiction finally giving credit to the independent intellect of Batman who no longer relies on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/alfred-pennyworth" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/alfred-pennyworth" target="_blank">Alfred’s</a> intellectual input, rather showcasing his detective skills throughout his mission to unmask the Riddler.</p>

<p>Following along with the Riddler’s games we are spoon-fed increments of Batman’s personality. While we come to understand quite early on that we are watching the storyline of a younger version of batman- only 2 years since Bruce Wayne took on the role of Batman, the rage and sadness of Bruce perfectly seeps through the poker-faced Batman façade, making him arguably the most violent depiction of Batman seen on screen so far. Batman is seen beating criminals within inches of their lives multiple times on screen, the most notable being just after the final battle between Batman and the Riddler’s men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The storyline becomes tainted by Batman’s discovery of his own family’s involvement in Gotham’s corruption, sending the young superhero down a questioning spiral of his own moral values, values that he once believed made him begin fighting for all the right reasons. From here we understand the praise Robert Pattison receives for his outstanding performance as the Batman as he finally shatters the role of Batman, letting Bruce’s emotions and thoughts take over as he fears for Alfred.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matt Reeves and Robert&#8217;s perfect on-screen balance between Batman’s strive for vengeance and Bruce’s yearning for companionship and approval ideally sets the film. The film perfectly captures a cinematic rebirth of Batman, this time pulling reality into the picture, also addressing the young side of Batman in great detail. Batman becomes strung along and tied in with the Riddler’s crimes, showcasing the vulnerability of the character and how much he still must learn.</p>



<p>However, whilst the main attention remains on Pattison’s performance as Batman and the future of his role as Batman, enough cannot be said about Zoe’s performance as Catwoman or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pauldanoofficial/?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/pauldanoofficial/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Dano’s</a> performance as The Riddler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reeve’s vision behind Catwoman also follows a comic book accurate anti-heroine whose relationship with Batman remains questionable. Despite Catwoman’s storyline not totally laying to rest the character&#8217;s historically twisted underpinning of a sexually charged creation, Catwoman is almost given her own legacy to avenge her mother’s and her friend’s (Annika) death and to ultimately leave Gotham. As to which, Zoe’s performance gives way for a strong female lead, leading the way for the future of Catwoman and leading by example for future female superheroes, villains, or anti-heroes within the DC universe.</p>

<p>Dano’s performance as the Riddler totally knocks <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jimcarrey__/?hl=en" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/jimcarrey__/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim Carrey’s</a> comic relief depiction of the character out of the park. Although their storylines are not close to comparable, the sheer psychological torture felt by his performance almost convinces us he truly does belong in Arkham, or even a real-life mental asylum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, &#8216;The Batman&#8217; (2022) has made way for some of the most promising live-action future depictions of the superhero franchise. From a cinematic rebirth of Batman to create a more tied down realistic depiction, focusing on building the character from the bottom, starting with his mental stability, to teasers of the Joker as the next villain camo, superhero fans are in for a long, but worthwhile, wait on the edge of their seats.
