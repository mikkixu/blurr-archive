<p>Do you wake up at sunrise to meditate and recite affirmations? Are you devoted to a 10-step skincare routine decked in Aesop and Glossier? Is your pantry stocked with dark leafy greens, vegan protein powder and a cornucopia of superfoods?&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the vast majority, the answers to these questions are no. For &#8216;That Girl,&#8217; however, it‚Äôs a yes, yes and yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since April 2021, TikTok has been saturated with video titles in the vein of, ‚ÄòTHAT girl morning routine,‚Äô ‚ÄòThis is your sign to become THAT girl‚Äô and ‚ÄòHow to become THAT girl.‚Äô Obscure as the phrase is, these videos follow a uniform format that involves early mornings, daily workouts and plant-based meals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike the usual fashion-centric trends that have emerged from the short-video sharing app, That Girl allegedly favours health and wellness over aesthetic appeal. It has become a Gen Z trope, portraying quintessential self-care techniques as catalysts for productivity. But when self-love and success are exclusively promoted by light-skinned women with 23-inch waists and ¬£80 workout leggings, how healthy is this health trend for its young and impressionable audience?</p>



<p>Some TikTok users deem That Girl as motivational. Others question its unrealistic glamourisation of health and wellness and posted more authentic depictions of their everyday lives. Australian TikToker, Hannah Powell (@the_peoples_princess), for example, shared a video emblazoned with the message: ‚ÄòWhen the aesthetics are immaculate, but you‚Äôre also depressed.‚Äô The video features classic That Girl elements, such as a well-decorated bedroom and a fetching outfit, before revealing piles of dirty clothes that would otherwise be hidden behind the camera. Hannah wrote the caption, ‚ÄòEverything is a lie ! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f921.png" alt="ü§°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />‚Äô</p>

<p>For users like Hannah, That Girl is a quixotic trend that treats wellness as a one-size-fits-all pursuit. In this sense, That Girl belongs to the minority. She constitutes the 1% of society, who can afford weekly Pilates classes and Whole Foods paraphernalia. Personally, I have never had enough energy to make an Instagrammable quinoa salad after my eight-hour work shift.</p>

<p>In a 2021 <strong><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13675494211055735#_i2">study on digital food cultures</a></strong>, wellness was described as being, ‚Äúdriven by the market and consumer culture as opposed to medical necessity.‚Äù Both physical and spiritual health were typified as ‚Äúmoving targets‚Äù that can never be fully actualised. With that, wellness is subsumed in the matrix of capitalism. Instead of a means to cure disease, it is a never-ending journey of reigning the mind and body through consumption. The more expensive a product is, the healthier it must be, right?</p>



<p>In theory, That Girl expresses self-love through a healthy lifestyle. In execution, it basks in the glory of name-brands and aesthetic appeal. And what is aesthetic appeal if not a crisp image of the newest <em>MacBook Pro</em> atop a <em>Lululemon</em> yoga mat? Even the bright and modern living spaces in which That Girl videos are set allude to a degree of wealth that many viewers can only romanticise from afar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, people are free to share the luxuries they have online. But as soon as a video compilation of material possessions is tagged #ThatGirl, the wellness trend becomes problematically conflated with financial status. For now, the closest I‚Äôll ever get to a penthouse apartment is by watching a That Girl video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúI really think That Girl is a toxic trend because it‚Äôs represented by rich women, who, to be honest, are usually white and thin. So there are social barriers that prevent other people from becoming That Girl,‚Äù 21-year-old Ciara told me. Our conversation about health swiftly transformed into a conversation about money. Being an art student working a part-time job, Ciara articulated the struggles of having to strictly budget her rent, food and transportation. She explained how she is left with little money for herself, which she is often forced to spend on art supplies for university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 5am, Ciara has just arrived home from her bartending job. Meanwhile, That Girl has just woken up and is now using a jade roller to depuff her face &#8211; or at least that‚Äôs what we see on TikTok. The distinction between the two has caused Ciara to feel nonplussed and excluded from the trend. The problem with That Girl is not the fact that she engages in generic notions of self-care. The problem with That Girl is the fact that she is a singular prototype devoid of nuance. She is a standard to be abided by. Girls who innately possess privileges inaccessible to most are favoured over girls like Ciara who face the less alluring side of self-improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ciara expressed her desire to see a wellness trend that is detached from social class. ‚ÄúEven before That Girl became popular, wellness was always promoted by influencers. They would talk about colonics and other over-the-top procedures that aren‚Äôt necessary to being well,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIt would make a world of difference if they used their influence to give practical health tips that everyone can do whether or not they‚Äôre rich.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That Girl how-to guides tend to trivialise wellness by offering esoteric advise. For instance, in a TikTok posted by @angelxadvice_, viewers were urged to ‚Äústop posting crying selfies‚Äù and to ‚Äúmake a sad playlist so you‚Äôre prepared for anything.‚Äù As well-favoured as an Instagram feed bereft of crying selfies may be, it does not exactly coincide with the ethos of self-help.&nbsp;</p>



https://www.tiktok.com/@urfavadv1cepage/video/6912776433475652865



<p>In an article published by i-D, Carl Cederstr√∂m, a professor at Stockholm University and the co-author of <em>The Wellness Syndrome</em>, defined contemporary notions of wellness as ideological, yet directionless: ‚ÄúOur culture of self-help generally has no purpose. You very rarely find a book on why you should lose weight. It‚Äôs always how you should lose weight.‚Äù This highlights how wellness is clouded by aspirations so ill-defined that they appear to be purely superficial. Instead of looking within ourselves, our attention is diverted to the social currency that is physical beauty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media is notoriously effective in idealising the good and hiding the bad. The That Girl trend is emblematic of this, collating videos of feigned perfection. Users have, however, become increasingly sceptical of the media. In a survey conducted amongst 42 students from Goldsmiths, University of London, 47.4% of participants agreed that That Girl was unrealistic. When asked if they deemed the trend harmful, 30% voted yes. One student wrote, ‚ÄúIt puts a lot of pressure on girls‚Äù and another stated, ‚ÄúTikTok isn‚Äôt the place to become a better person.‚Äù</p>



<p>That Girl presents glimpses of reality, but depicts them as the full truth. Watching a mere 30 seconds of a rigorous morning routine can quickly be misinterpreted as a full 24 hours of someone else‚Äôs picturesque life. I, myself, fall prey to That Girl‚Äôs endless hustle. I know I‚Äôm not alone in saying that I‚Äôm tantalised by her good looks and effortless sublimity. It‚Äôs easy to simply want to be her, but becoming her is a different story that glosses over social inequalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that <strong><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-right-mindset/201910/the-rise-and-grind-hustle-culture">research</a></strong> shows that hustle culture isn‚Äôt the only path towards self-optimisation. By redefining That Girl in your own terms, wellness can be extended beyond capitalistic structures. Instead of succumbing to external pressures, success should be approached with self-compassion, mindfulness and fortitude. Outside of social media, That Girl exists everywhere. She is Ciara, who manages to conquer the day no matter how sleep-deprived she might be. She is Hannah, who confidently defies That Girl‚Äôs picture-perfect bedroom. She is every girl resolved to be the best version of herself through the ups and downs of a life that isn‚Äôt always Instagram-ready.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size"><em><strong>Learn to love the skin you&#8217;re in, without having to change it.</strong></em></p>



<p>When you google acne, a million and one websites appear selling treatments and products that promise to miraculously clear your skin. Drink four litres of water every day, sleep with silk pillowcases, shot apple cider vinegar every morning and spend thousands on chemical peels. </p>



<p>The information comes at you from every angle, and it can be extremely overwhelming. Not to mention that they‚Äôre usually based off no factual data or scientific evidence.</p>



<p>Having suffered with acne for the last six years of my life, I have felt the desperation that led me to try all these tips and tricks off random women on the internet. None of which worked.</p>



<p>Since I was 16, I have tried multiple medications, treatments, and home remedies and despite all of this I still have acne. At times it really improves. Then out of nowhere new spots appear, and my confidence plummets back down to below zero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cycle continues.</p>



<p>Now at 22, after the hard realisation that the acne isn‚Äôt going anywhere just yet, I had to change the way I viewed myself. For my mental health‚Äôs sake, I have done a lot of work on my inner-self, and I now spend less time trying and failing to ‚Äòfix‚Äô my skin.</p>



<p>Instead, I have learnt to love the skin I‚Äôm in, regardless of its appearance. As contrary to popular belief, we don‚Äôt have that much control over the appearance of our skin. But we can control our mindset.</p>



<p>Here are some simple steps to help change the way you view yourself and your skin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Try and Go Makeup Free</u></strong></p>



<p>I know the thought may seem daunting. I really struggle to leave the house without makeup, especially when my acne has flared up particularly badly. Makeup serves as a safety blanket, and concealer my best friend. When I‚Äôve covered my face with a thick layer of paint, I can be blemish free, and I instantly feel more confident.</p>



<p>I know that feeling of insecurities creeping in all too well. &nbsp;It can make the thought of heading out the door bare faced seem almost impossible, even if you are just popping to Tesco. You worry that everyone will be looking at your skin, viewing you as unattractive or even dirty.</p>



<p>To unlearn that clear skin equals beautiful, I try to go make-up free some days, to find my confidence from within. One day this week, I challenge you to try it.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll go first.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://mccs-journalism.gold.ac.uk/wp/blurr/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/03/acne-final-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-600" width="611" height="611"/><figcaption>Personal Image</figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Do Not Avoid Socialising</u></strong></p>



<p>Socialising can be really anxiety provoking when you have acne. I can remember quite a few times I have said no to seeing my friends because my skin was having a flare up. I was worried about what people might think of me.</p>



<p>One Saturday night a few years ago and I was getting ready to go out with my friends. I put concealer on, then foundation. Then powder. More powder. Nothing would cover my spots. I looked in the mirror and all I could see was my acne.</p>



<p>I was so exhausted and angry. I scrubbed at my face with a wipe, until the makeup was all off. I was about to start re-applying but with a heavier foundation this time when I caught my reflection in the mirror.</p>



<p>I gave up, and I didn‚Äôt go out. I was so worried that all people would look at was my acne. I missed out on a night of drinking, dancing, and making memories with my friends. I regret all the times I cancelled plans because I was insecure about my skin.</p>



<p>In reality no-one is even looking, let alone judging.</p>



<p>So, go out and have fun. Don‚Äôt let your skin get in the way of your life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Filter Who You Follow</u></strong></p>



<p>Social media can be a toxic place. Scrolling all day on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok is unsurprisingly bad for our mental health. But if you suffer with acne, it can be even worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of filters and airbrushing creates a false narrative that everyone, everywhere, has ‚Äòperfect‚Äô skin.</p>



<p>No spots. No skin texture. Just smooth, glowing, tanned blemish-free faces.</p>



<p>Social media is lying to us all.</p>



<p>Constantly seeing ‚Äòperfect‚Äô skin every time you open the app can be really difficult for people who suffer with skin problems. So, if Instagram is making you feel insecure, it might be useful to have a re-think of who you follow.</p>



<p>Go through the accounts on your feed and ask yourself, ‚ÄòDoes this person make me feel good or bad about myself?‚Äô If the answer is bad, you know what to do.</p>



<p>There are also lots of skin positive accounts on Instagram, where people share their journey with acne. Following these has really helped me find my confidence. It‚Äôs refreshing to see selfies with spots, scarring and skin texture. It reminds you that you are not alone, and that acne is much more common than you might think.</p>

<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><u>Positive Skin Affirmations</u></strong></p>



<p>When my skin is bad, I sometimes find myself looking in the mirror and speaking so negatively about myself in my head.</p>



<p>‚ÄòYour acne is back.‚Äô ‚ÄòYou look disgusting.‚Äô ‚ÄòYou need to cover up your skin.‚Äô</p>



<p>I grasped what I was doing, and realised I needed to change this. Why am I putting myself down? If one of my friends had acne, would I say this to them? After asking myself these questions, I realised that I needed to start using positive affirmations instead.</p>



<p>Now, when I look I the mirror, particularly if I am having a bad skin day, I start my morning with some positive affirmations.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know saying affirmations isn‚Äôt going to change my skin or confidence overnight. But, if you are consistent with them, it can have a hugely positive effect on your self-esteem and thinking pattern.</p>



<p>Positive affirmations are a way of actively swapping a negative mindset for a positive one.&nbsp; For example, if I‚Äôm feeling insecure about my acne I might say, ‚ÄòI feel happy in my skin.‚Äô</p>



<p>Here are some skin affirmations you can try:</p>



<p>My skin is beautiful.</p>



<p>My skin protects me.</p>



<p>My skin is healing.</p>



<p>I am becoming more comfortable with my imperfections.</p>



<p>My skin does not define me.</p>
