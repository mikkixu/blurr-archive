<p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><em><strong>If you will not let us into your spaces, we will create our own.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>LGBTQ+ and Ethnic communities struggle to find places where they feel welcome and can party and drink without the fear of being &#8216;othered&#8217; and alienated because of who they are and how they present. It is rare to find spaces that are controlled and populated by members of the LGBTQBIPOC community. Even the clubs that solely exist for the LGBTQ+ communities end up infiltrated and demonised by white cis-hetro fragile men. Or they exclude BIPOC members of the community. So to piss them off more, here is a list of the top 5 LGBTQBIPOC friendly clubs for the community and they actually have good music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>From being only open once a month to now a fully venue house party located under the Vauxhall arches, LICK is now notorious amongst the femme and non-binary club goers. It isn’t a place for cisgendered men, that’s right they are <strong>NOT ALLOWED</strong> to enter this safe space where all femmes and enbees under the LGBTQ+ rainbow umbrella are able to whine up on each other with no fear of harassment and bigotry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pxssy palace screams unapologetically queer, with its inclusive themes like: fairycore, signs, engagements and many more. It is the place to be and that&#8217;s if you can get tickets. It is always sold out as everyone rushes to attend their themed events, a haven for all women and femmes of colour. A place for them to feel liberated and able to express themselves and their desires. A night of straight hits, celebrating all things femme, trans, non-binary, queer and ethnic.&nbsp;In just four years Pxssy Place has reached legendary status with producers, iconic DJs and celebrity performances like Bree Runway.</p>

<p>A sober club night centred around healing and inclusion for LGBTQBPOC members, Misery Party focuses on healing workshops, nail bars and a resident DJ for their sober and uplifting club nights. Misery invites the members of the community who don’t partake in drinking culture and are still trying to find their tribe. To come as you are even if you are struggling with your mental health, substance abuse, or are ultimately just quiet, sad and want to have a good time.  Misery is truly a communal space who work on decolonising and de-capitalising the club space whilst uplifting LGBTQBPOC in the meantime.  </p>
