<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">We all want more money, right? That is exactly what we have seen online with Cryptocurrency making people millions. But does it work? And how hard is it?</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Since the beginning of Decentralized (DeFi) cryptocurrency in 2009, with the creation of Bitcoin, the ‘crypto-verse’ has taken the online world by storm. Despite financial institutions, such as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk" target="_blank">Bank of England</a>, warning investors to be prepared to lose all their money, it is estimated that around <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCtYOYhOf2AhVRZcAKHa7nBMQQFnoECAUQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcybercrew.uk%2Fblog%2Fcryptocurrency-statistics-uk%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gk1YE58ULO1DfsuKyGhn_" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCtYOYhOf2AhVRZcAKHa7nBMQQFnoECAUQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcybercrew.uk%2Fblog%2Fcryptocurrency-statistics-uk%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gk1YE58ULO1DfsuKyGhn_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.8 million</a> people in the U.K. hold some sort of Cryptocurrency as of February 2021.</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Alongside the rise in interest towards NFT’s (Non-fungible token), even those who don’t invest in cryptocurrency have heard all about it, and the possible rewards that come with investing. From social media trends surrounding ‘<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dogecoin.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dogecoin.com" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a>’ to headlines from an ex-McDonald’s worker to a crypto millionaire, cryptocurrency has certainly gained a lot of interest, especially among younger generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Definitely invest,” said <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/itsnowkone/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/itsnowkone/" target="_blank">Kone Oumar</a>, a 19-year-old cryptocurrency investor. Despite his initial fears of “losing money and investing in bad projects”, he said that investing into cryptocurrency has made him “more financially stable and more aware of how he spends his money”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially being introduced to cryptocurrency back in 2014 and looking it up online he “wasn’t really interested”. However, after the upward trend in cryptocurrency being seen as a get-rich-quick scheme, Kone decided to invest. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Introduced after the 2008 financial crash many consider cryptocurrency to be a “true innovation on money,” such as David, a representative for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://titano.finance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://titano.finance/" target="_blank">Titano Finance</a> and the Titano community.  “Cryptocurrency is an industry that utilises a particular type of technology to create value.  Money gets its value by all of us agreeing that something is worth something”.  </p>

<p>Titano is a ‘DeFi’ token that launched in November 2021 and is the first of its kind, making use of its ‘Titano Autostaking Protocol’ (TAP) makes “staking easier and gives TITANO token holders the highest stable returns in crypto” via rebase rewards.</p>



<p>People “want to claim their full value from the financial system,” said David. “We’ve been so used to settling for what we have, and we live in a society that believes in the scarcity principle: if I have it, you can’t have it, so I gotta keep it from you,&#8221; a principle cryptocurrency offers a way out from.</p>



<p>According to Titano, their coin “provides platforms, tools and guidance so each of our investors and partners can learn and participate and profit from it”, proving the &#8216;crypto-verse&#8217; to possibly not be as volatile as one would believe and friendlier for the new investors. </p>



<p>With many young people finding cryptocurrency hard to navigate, “we need more creators willing to create straight forward introductions into the scene&#8221;,  which is why auto-staking or rebase tokens such as Titano’s make investing in cryptocurrency easy, taking by “the learning curve down to zero.&#8221;</p>

<p>Titano is a community-run rebase token. This means that “the supply of the token is increased or decreased algorithmically, based on the current price of each token”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Titano makes use of this formula to “increase the token supply, allowing  Titano holders to keep growing their tokens” and therefore, making profit from the money they put into the coin. “It’s a grand experiment. I want to give power to the people,” said David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency can often feel like a gamble. “The scammers are very motivated, very smart and come up with ways that you know, you just thought you had no idea was possible,” said David. Titano team members, like many other cryptocurrency teams, remain anonymous, which can often deter many from investing. However, he thinks that anonymity provides a sense of security, not only to the team members but to users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked why the Titano team remain anonymous despite fears held by investors, he said that doxing “is typically done so you can verify who it is that you are dealing with. There is much better ways to protect yourself than having someone’s name or ‘linkedin’ which could also be faked.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Come in and spend some time, get to know the space. See if you like it. Ask the tough questions. Do your research. Read the <a href="https://docs.titano.finance/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://docs.titano.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">white paper</a>, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzp4XQqxucZ-R7TgT-Ug3pg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzp4XQqxucZ-R7TgT-Ug3pg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMA’s</a> and see what we do,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sean Edwards, a 20-year-old Titano investor, first started investing in cryptocurrency in March 2021. He was inspired by “the incentive to make amounts of money that would have taken me years to make using traditional methods,<strong>”</strong> adding that “better APR rates” makes cryptocurrency more appealing than mainstream banking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He stated that cryptocurrency is totally worth it but “only if you’re willing to do your own research and accept that you don’t know it all”. Going on to add that you shouldn’t “invest more than you’re willing to lose.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Like David, Edwards believes that the anonymity associated with the &#8216;DeFi&#8217; side of cryptocurrency is a positive. “I like that I&#8217;m able to invest privately. We want to be our own banks; we want financial freedom.&#8221;</p>



<p>To those unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, this may sound, as Edwards says, “naïve and dangerously optimistic,” but he feels this proves that we have “been conditioned into thinking that we can’t achieve our financial dreams. This is what crypto aims to change.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Bitcoin is Gold 2.0. It&#8217;s a huge, huge, huge deal.”</p><cite>Chamath Palihapitiya, Venture Capitalist (Video Below)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ddcg4/video_chamath_palihapitiya_bitcoin_is_gold_20_its/">[Video] Chamath Palihapitiya &#8220;Bitcoin Is Gold 2.0.

</div></figure>



<p>Although cryptocurrency is decentralised, there is a sense of community found among investors, which has allowed projects within the cryptocurrency universe to thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community members helping one another get involved into cryptocurrency. “Through interacting with people in the Telegram groups and on discord, there is a sense of a common goal to build something unique in the DeFi space,” said Edwards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point in time, cryptocurrency is still considered to be a gamble. A lot more research needs to be done. But the future importance of cryptocurrency is becoming clearer as the technology develops. With Bitcoin now being a legal tender, cryptocurrency is now becoming more relevant than ever. With talks of cryptocurrency soon becoming a way of paying for everyday items and a new way to break away from the 9-5 life, we should give cryptocurrency more of a thought.&nbsp;</p>
